Troy,NY,Columbia University,Pursuit,,2015,,Murugesu Sivapalan,,,,NY,,,,,,,"Freshwater security poses one of the largest challenges of the 21st century, with uncertain future supplies due to climate change and increasing demands on water as populations grow and ecosystem services become increasingly valued. Human impacts on water resources and ecosystems have grown, but the ability of freshwater sciences to understand and model interlinked human and hydrologic systems has not kept pace. In part, this reflects the lack of collaboration between socio-economic specialists and hydrologists; and in part, it reflects a tendency of hydrological models to treat human impacts on water systems as exogenous, complex, and place-specific issues. This project aims to address both these issues by creating a series of collaborative workshops that will bring together hydrologists, ecologists, and social scientists to undertake synthesis research in the nascent field of socio-hydrology. These workshops will investigate case studies drawn from real-world water problems to discover common behaviors and governing relationships in coupled human-water-ecology systems. The goal of the project is to build a new generation of generic conceptual models and ñsocio-hydrologicî modeling frameworks that transcend place-based complexity, and advance understanding of the dynamics and co-evolution of human, water, and eco-environmental systems.","Socio-ecological System Resilience, Climate Change, & Adaptive Water Governance",SESYNC,,2013,,Barbara Cosens,ID,University of Idaho,Pursuit,,2015,,Lance Gunderson,,,,ID,,,,,,,"Water, in addition to its role in sustaining human life, supports ecosystems that provide many of the services society relies on. Yet our governance of major water systems has not placed them on a path toward sustainability. Resilience thinking provides a bridging concept between knowledge of the biophysical system and governance principles to move systems of water and society to a more sustainable future. Resilience is a measure of the amount of perturbation a social-ecological system can withstand while maintaining its structure and functions. Research to facilitate sustainability in major water basins must focus not only on ecological resilience, but on how to achieve that resilience in a manner perceived as legitimate by the participants in a democratic society and that begins with the current hierarchical and fragmented system as the baseline from which new approaches must be applied. Achieving this level of integration between ecological concepts and governance requires a dialogue across multiple disciplines, including ecologists with expertise in ecological resilience, hydrologists and climate experts, with social scientists and legal scholars.",Climate Change & Water Resources Adaptation: Decision Scaling & Integrated Edo-engineering Resilience,SESYNC,,2013,,N.

Matthews,,,,CO,,,,,,,"Climate change is rapidly altering the global water cycle, challenging societyÍs ability to sustainably manage water both for people (electricity, cities, agriculture) and for aquatic ecosystems and species. One of the most difficult needs for sustainable water management is understanding how to design dams or ecosystem management plans capable of working over many decades, even centuries, particularly when our understanding of future climate is highly uncertain at the scale of individual river basins. Further, regions where rapid new dam development is occurring often that lack a reliable historic record to guide sustainable water choices. The expertise that exists to address these challenges is fragmented between academics and field practitioners and between disciplines such as ecology, engineering, and hydrology.","Advancing Research on the Perception, Role, & Function of Urban Green Infrastructure by Bridging the SESYNC Synthesis Process with an Open Community Engagement Process for Software Development",SESYNC,,2013,,Barbara Minsker,IL,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,,,2015,,"Larry Band, Stan Ahalt",,,,IL,,,,,,,"The purpose of this project is to test the hypothesis that the SESYNC process for team-synthesis research can be accelerated by new cyberinfrastructure specific to the research question, particularly when the domain scientists participate in the development process of the cyber tools.

The WSSI mission will be to concurrently transform the research culture and the software culture of the water science community. Water sustainability is an urgent, complex, and trans-disciplinary problem. Complex biophysical and social processes influence water use, quality, and availability. Few research areas have a greater need for modern cyberinfrastructure tools than water science, yet progress on meeting the grand challenge of water sustainability is hindered by insufficient coordination and collaboration among the exceptionally diverse research communities involved and because community-developed software and cyberinfrastructure have not been professionally designed to be interoperable, sustainable, or reusable. This conceptualization phase will use an open community engagement process with assistance from the National Socio-environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC), to involve the water science community in activities that simultaneously synthesize input for the strategic plan and serve as prototypes of the processes the Institute will use to achieve its mission. Specifically, the conceptualization grant will fund two synthesis workshops that will define the functional elements of the Institute, a community forum that will present the Institute concept to stakeholder communities for their input, and a software prototyping activity that will demonstrate and evaluate methods for developing a culture of production-quality software engineering within the water science community. Between community engagement activities, the project will produce white papers on the elements of the Institute that will be incorporated into the WSSI strategic plan.<br/><br/>The vision for the WSSI is to facilitate the development of sustainable, production- quality cyberinfrastructure that will be used to advance transformative water science. By developing activities that put water scientists, computer scientists, software engineers, and social scientists in the same room with a common purpose, such an institute would drive collaborations that produce innovative ideas and new research. The conceptualization approach will continuously define, test, evaluate, and refine the conceptual model of the Institute in order to produce a strategic plan that serves the needs of the stakeholder communities. This process and its products - the prototype elements of the Institute, the white papers that describe them, and the strategic plan - will advance an understanding of how to form and sustain effective trans-disciplinary collaborations. Software developed as a result of the prototyping activity will be used to advance water science research. Thorough planning will mitigate the risks inherent in standing up the first software institute and will address the challenge of building broad community support to sustain the Institute after NSF funding ends."1049273,NSF Workshop on Creating Scientific Software Innovation Institutes for Sustained Cyberinfrastructure Achievement and Excellence,ACI,CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE,10/1/10,9/20/10,Stanley Ahalt,NC,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Standard Grant,Gabrielle D.

The complexity of how disparate software elements form a cohesive, sustainable cyberinfrastructure becomes staggering, as more elements are produced from an increasing number of funded initiatives targeting technological capability and community interactions at national and international scales. The environmental observatory community ecosystem must encompass all elements comprising this cyberinfrastructure, crosscutting through technologies, disciplines, communities, and practices towards accelerating scientific progress and competitiveness. NSF-funded environmental observatories and related cyberinfrastructure projects are broad and span many communities including AON (Arctic Observing Network), CHyMP (CUAHSI Hydrologic Modeling Platform), CUAHSI HIS (CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System), CZOs (Critical Zone Observatories), HydoNexrad (Hydro Next-generation Radar), LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research), NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network), OOI (Ocean Observing Initiative), and WSC (Water Sustainability and Climate Program).

To date, progress on grand challenge-scale water research has been hindered by a lack of interoperability among data and computing resources that in-turn stems from a lack of coordination and rigor in software development practices across the water science community. This project formalizes and expands planning efforts initiated by a fall 2010 workshop on software challenges of the NSF's Environmental Observatory Networks (NSF Award #1049273) to develop a Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) centered on water science and environmental observation. The plan will guide formation of a Water Science Software Institute (WSSI) that addresses the community's interoperability problem by using Open Source principles to enable innovative and sustainable scientific software.<br/><br/>The project involves two main activities: 1) determining the scope and the cyberinfrastructure requirements of the water science the WSSI addresses, and 2) developing a plan to apply the Open Source community model to this community of scientific research communities. To guide planning activities, two driving use cases are investigated: evaluating watershed best management practices, and understanding nitrogen dynamics and the impact of ecological patch structure. The use cases provide a source of cyberinfrastructure requirements and targets against which to evaluate the plan as it develops. The planning process mitigates the risks inherent in standing up this new kind of software institute, and it is a first step toward demonstrating how a software institute will transform water science."1204368,WSC- Category 3: Collaborative Research: Water Sustainability under Near-term Climate Change : A cross-regional analysis incorporating socio-ecological feedbacks and adaptations,CBET,"CR-Water Sustainability & Clim, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY",9/1/12,8/10/13,Sankarasubraman Arumugam,NC,North Carolina State University,Continuing grant,Debra Reinhart,8/31/16,"$890,576.00 ","Kenneth Kunkel, Emily Zechman, Tushar Sinha, Gnanamanikam Mahinthakumar",sankar_arumugam@ncsu.edu,CAMPUS BOX 7514,RALEIGH,NC,276957514,9195152444,ENG,"7977, 7643",9251,$0.00 ,"1204368/1204396/1204478<br/>Sankarasubraman Arumugam/ John Kominoski/ John Sabo<br/>North Carolina State University/University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc./Arizona State University<br/><br/>Water resource availability varies across the Sunbelt of the United States with a sharp East-West transition at 105 degrees W. Arid regions west of the 105th Meridian produce less runoff compared to humid regions in the East that produce greater than 40 cm of mean annual runoff. Consequently, reservoirs in the West are over-year systems holding multiple years of inflows, whereas reservoirs in the East are within-year storage systems with the need to refill the system in the beginning of spring. Accordingly, water policies also differ substantially with western states pursuing (""prior appropriation"") and the eastern states following (""riparian rights"") for allocation. These contrasting strategies also impact freshwater biodiversity with the ratio of non-native to native fish species being nearly 6 times higher in the West compared to the East. In spite of these cross-regional differences, both regions face two common stressors: (a) uncertainty in available freshwater arising from global climate change and (b) increased human demand due to population growth and consumption. Consequently, there is an ever-increasing need for an integrated assessment of freshwater sustainability under these two stressors over the planning horizon (10-30 years). The main objective of this study is to understand and quantify the potential impacts of near-term climate change and population growth on freshwater sustainability - defined here as integrating daily to annual flows required to minimize human vulnerability and maximize ecosystem needs (including native biodiversity) for freshwater - by explicitly incorporating the feedbacks from human-environmental systems on water supply and demand in various target basins spanning Arizona to North Carolina. Using retro-analyses involving AR5 multimodel climate change hindcasts, we will revisit how freshwater sustainability could have been better achieved over the past five decades across the Sunbelt.

Findings from the AR5 retro-analyses will evaluate and recommend societal options (i.e., supply augmentation vs. demand reduction) for promoting future (2015-2034) freshwater sustainability across the Sunbelt. Cross-regional synthesis of policies and media sources for the targeted basins will identify de-centralized adaptive strategies that have been employed independently and collectively to maintain flows, increase supplies, or reduce demands. Utilizing the near-term hydroclimatic projections, PIs will quantify how current policies on reservoir operations and groundwater extraction could impact the reliability of future water supplies for cities and also alter the key attributes of hydrographs that are critical for maintaining freshwater biodiversity.

Existing freshwater resources are being challenged by increasingly unsustainable land use and water use practices. The distribution, abundance and quality of freshwater supplies will undoubtedly also be affected by projected climate change and variability. Unless landscapes are managed proactively in the future, sustaining even the present level of ecosystem goods and services that aquatic systems provide will be impossible. Among the most pressing environmental challenges related to freshwater are how to formulate and implement sustainable, science-based, strategies to adapt to climate variation, land use change, and other consequences of human development. To address this challenge, we will develop an integrative mechanistic model accounting explicitly for human-landscape interactions. Our coupled human-landscape model incorporates linkages and feedbacks among atmospheric, terrestrial, aquatic, and social processes to predict the potential impact of climate variability, climate change, land use, and human activity on water resources at decadal to centennial scales in the Central Great Plains region of North America. This part of the United States has longstanding water quality and quantity concerns resulting from extreme climate variability, intensive water uses and land uses. Furthermore, the regional socio-economic system is challenged by dramatic population shifts, concentration of land tenure, dependency on highly variable and limited water supplies, economic uncertainty, and strong cultural resistance to top-down government regulation. Both human and natural systems in this area depend on adequate freshwater for survival, but are fragile, quickly and dramatically affected by climate fluctuations, and potentially facing disaster given either natural or anthropogenically-driven climate scenarios. In the first three components of the project, we develop and interactively couple mechanistic models of the three systems controlling water supply and water quality ? the hydrosystem, the aquatic ecosystem, and the human system. In the fourth research component, these three system models are integrated in two ways. First, we use an agent-based decision model to evaluate wholesystem (hydrosystem, aquatic ecosystem, human system) response to climate variation scenarios derived from historical climate data and downscaled climate projections. Second, we use policy optimization modeling to identify the most effective strategies to achieve sustainability within a culturally appropriate context. <br/><br/>This research will produce benefits to society by providing tools and frameworks that will guide policy formulation and implementation of incentives and regulations to ensure the sustainability of coupled hydrological, ecological, and human systems in the Central Great Plains and beyond. Our research has the potential to transform the science supporting water sustainability efforts on several fronts. Specifically, our research will: (a) improve our ability to translate climate model outputs into more understandable and relevant weather-scale events ; (b) produce a better understanding of how and why landowners make water-use decisions; (c) develop a spatially-explicit, landscape-scale synthesis of existing ecological data to understand how climate changes and watershed alterations impact riverscape-scale biodiversity, (d) facilitate understanding of how climate change will act in conjunction with and exacerbate a range of other stressors to impact the functions of wetlands, and (e) produce a usable policy optimization model to help governments move towards societally acceptable and achievable water sustainability. These advances will directly contribute to the sustainability of economically important agricultural systems, biologically significant ecosystems, urban population clusters, and clean water supplies."1318140,WSC- Category 3: Collaborative Research: Water Sustainability under Near-term Climate Change : A cross-regional analysis incorporating socio-ecological feedbacks and adaptations,CBET,CR-Water Sustainability & Clim,9/1/12,7/22/13,John Kominoski,FL,Florida International University,Continuing grant,Debra Reinhart,8/31/16,"$111,132.00 ",,jkominos@fiu.edu,11200 SW 8TH ST,Miami,FL,331990001,3053482494,ENG,7977,,$0.00 ,"1204368/1204396/1204478<br/>Sankarasubraman Arumugam/ John Kominoski/ John Sabo<br/>North Carolina State University/University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc./Arizona State University<br/><br/>Water resource availability varies across the Sunbelt of the United States with a sharp East-West transition at 105 degrees W.

This question is how to promote human well-being in a region dependent on a changing water system. The Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia are connected through a flood-pulse hydrology and river-floodplain connectivity upon which humans are dependent for rice farming, fish production, and social lifeways. Current rapid changes in land use, hydropower development, human activity, and climate will all have significant impacts on the predictability of the flood-pulse system and the availability of water in the future. This research connects the natural and human system through the study of the ecosystem services provided by the water system, which in turn support and sustain human life. Through the assembled team, the research focuses on all dimensions of the region?s ecosystem services including the provision, adaptation, valuation, and response mechanisms. The results of this project will set the stage to measure and explain critical interactions and impacts of a social-ecological system on the brink of profound transformation driven by demographic shifts, rapid economic growth, hydropower installations and climate change. <br/><br/>This research develops a framework to answer the central research questions: (1) What is the set of likely future land-use and climate scenarios for the region and how will they affect the hydrological system? (2) What is the relationship between the hydrological system and the generation of the ecosystem services necessary for sustainable agricultural production? (3) How do human populations depend on the ecosystem services provided by the hydrological system and respond to changes in the provision of these ecosystem services? and, (4) What are the tradeoffs associated with alternative choices for water sustainability? <br/><br/>This project will serve as a precursor to a more significant NSF WSC Category 2 proposal, in which the data and modeling framework will be implemented to assess the physical and economic ecosystem service tradeoffs associated with alternative approaches to ensuring water sustainability in the region. This research develops a set of plausible future scenarios based on climate change, land use, and human activity in the Lower Mekong Region. A cross-discplinary team of experts develops integrative ecological-economic models to assess the consequences of changes on human well-being.

While it is known that this mountain range's steep gradients in elevation, soils and vegetation render it extremely sensitive to climate change, the connection between the underlying hydrologic processes and the water sustainability issues in these regions is not well understood. This project will quantify the effect of a range of documented climate change scenarios on snow melt, runoff, high elevation reservoir operation (hydropower, flood control and recreation) and low elevation multi-purpose reservoir operation (irrigation, flood control, environmental flows and recreation). The San Joaquin River Basin will serve as the prototype for this study, the outcomes of which will be transferrable to other snowpack-controlled river basins. The scientific goal of the proposed project is to connect our emerging process-level understanding of climatic influences on mountain hydrologic processes and resulting changes to the stream response to the ecosystems services sustained by water but dictated by human values and policies. The hypothesis is that changing climate variability in the semi-arid western U.S., and the resulting shift toward an earlier annual runoff in snow-dominated watersheds will create a ripple effect, propagating down the mountain front to force human responses in the form of changes to high elevation hydropower and lowland water supply reservoir operations, and therefore changes to lowland aquatic and riparian ecosystem functions. We will test this hypothesis using current hydrologic process simulation models integrate existing data from the NSF Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory, and from state (California Department of Water Resources) and federal agencies (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). These simulation models will be driven by archival Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs (temperature, precipitation) for the years 2010 - 2099.<br/><br/>This project will clarify the connection between likely climate change scenarios, stream flows, reservoir storage and releases, and groundwater storage and extractions for snow-dependent river basins. Furthermore, through engagement with key river basin stakeholders, the project will result in practical guidelines to how best to adapt policy to the changing hydrologic conditions in order to sustain water supply, energy and aquatic ecosystem needs in the future. The San Joaquin River basin was selected as the subject of study because it embodies water and sustainability issues in the semi-arid West given (1) its vulnerability to climatic variation due to its reliance on snow pack and a network of reservoirs for hydropower, flood control, and water supply; and (2) its massive lowland river salmon restoration effort, which was initiated in Fall 2009."954405,CAREER: Climate Informed Uncertainty Analyses for Integrated Water Resources Sustainability,CBET,ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY,6/1/10,7/24/13,Sankarasubraman Arumugam,NC,North Carolina State University,Continuing grant,Bruce K.

However the region remains among the most underdeveloped in the world despite these natural advantages and despite the presence of 25% of the world's surface water resources in its great lakes. Human population growth in the region averages 3% per year and is substantially higher near lakeshores, fish populations are plummeting in response to over fishing and environmental stress, lake levels and outflows to Africa's three largest rivers shift dramatically from year to year as a result of a near-but-teetering balance between fresh water input and evaporative loss, ground water supply and quality are deteriorating, soil erosion is depleting soil fertility, and other aspects of environmental degradation, resulting from high dependence on direct utilization of natural resources, are threatening the lake ecosystems, local water supplies, agricultural productivity, and human welfare. Investigators will meet as a team during the coming year to develop an interdisciplinary research plan for water sustainability and climate in the Lake Malawi basin, which on the one hand typifies much of the great lakes region of tropical East Africa, but on the other lies precariously close to the southern Africa rainfall regime, which is predicted to become more arid with future climate change. The team will develop a set of hypotheses in the context of theoretical frameworks that encompass over-arching issues of forcing, response, and feedbacks in the areas of climate, water, and human activity. They plan two meetings: the first in Minnesota where they will address key questions and identify additional information and data that need to be collected in time for a second meeting to be held 3-4 months later in Malawi to formulate a proposal for a WSC Category II project in the following year. While this project will focus on the Malawi basin, the results will be applicable to most of tropical East Africa, where the conditions of climate and society are quite similar. While this planning phase of their research plan does not involve students, their goal is to succeed in developing a funded, five-year research program that will involve American students working with them and their Malawi colleagues in East Africa, as well as creating opportunities for African faculty and students to be involved with all aspects of the research.

This award is based on a new hypothesis that challenges the prevailing paradigm that CyanoHABs can be countered by control of the single nutirent, phosphorus (P). The new paradigm-challenging hypothesis is that nitrogen (N) loading in large lakes controls phytoplankton community structure, and that magnitude, spatial extent, and duration of CyanoHABs in large lakes are strongly dependent on both N and P inputs. This award is appropriate for the INSPIRE program due to the proposed transformational paradigm shift as well as the proposed problem-driven research that requires a comprehensive and integrative approach (ecosystem science as well as engineering analysis) to the grand challenge issue of ensuring availability of adequate quality freshwater resources. The fundamental questions raised are at the interface of biological science and engineering research. An additional challenge is addressing this new paradigm in the context of evolving climatic conditions. While it is crucial to understand how input reductions of N and P substrates can beneficially shape phytoplankton communities, this needs to be accomplished while accounting for climatic variations that are known to favor CyanoHABs. Managing nutrients requires an engineering solution, but implementation can only be successful if it is ecologically-constrained, so that the resulting biological species are desirable (e.g., non-toxin producing genera). Moreover, given the time frame required for traditional surveys of remediation success (i.e., years), the development of more rapid indicators is needed that will show more quickly whether an ecosystem is on a trajectory towards desired sustainability. How future climatic conditions will favor CyanoHAB formation must and will be considered. As more external pressure is placed on aquatic systems to provide ecosystems services, interdisciplinary (molecular, toxicological, biogeochemical, geohydrologic) efforts are needed to address the problem and ensure long term sustainability. In this research, in situ bioassays will be employed as well as quantitative mapping of gene expression to determine how various amounts of anthropogenic N (including ammonium and nitrate) and P (as phosphate) shape phytoplankton community structure and function and also CyanoHAB potential under ambient and elevated temperatures consistent with warming trends in a large lake basin. The particular place-based study will done on Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China. The Lake Taihu study will be accomplished using mesocosms in a recently constructed flow-thru pond system, located at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Taihu Lake Laboratory for Environmental Research field station. In collaboration with Chinese researchers, data from sites in Taihu will be collected to compare experimental conditions to seasonal in situ bloom dynamics. Results will be used to calibrate and verify eutrophication-CyanoHAB modeling. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS<br/>An immediate societal product will be a science-based nutrient input reduction strategy for Chinese provincial/central governments that will bring and maintain Taihu below the CyanoHAB threshold and be transferrable to shallow hypereutrophic lakes worldwide that are experiencing both N and P over-enrichment. Student journalists and a U.S. (UNC/UTK) - China (Hohai, Nanjing Universities, NIGLAS, Chinese Academy of Sciences) student exchange will disseminate successes and the emerging scientific results to the general public.

While the lead U.S. institution is UNC-CH, the U.S. partner institution (UTK) is an EPSCoR institution, so this study will support students that are historically under-supported and typically limited with hands-on research experience.

Recent changes in climate and vegetation cover (e.g. fire suppression, beetle infestation, fire) have potentially large, yet unrealized implications for water availability and ecosystem health. Forest structure has profound effects on snow accumulation and snowmelt via interception, attenuation of solar radiation, and other processes. We currently lack the mechanistic understanding needed to address the impacts of annual, decadal and long-term forest dynamics on snowmelt dynamics and water resources. This project targets this knowledge gap via an integrated observing and modeling approach focused on rates of snow accumulation and snowmelt in open versus sub-canopy conditions across an elevational gradient. Distributed hydrologic instrument clusters spanning an elevational gradient in the Colorado Front Range will be used to explore interactions between snow and vegetation, and improve predictions of snow-vegetation interactions associated with climate and vegetation change. Detailed analyses of canopy radiative transfer using hemispherical photography will be used to explain observed differences in snowpack dynamics and to develop robust forcings for detailed snowmelt simulations. The distributed instrument clusters represent the first comprehensive network of co-located snow, soil, and vegetation water use measurements spanning a continental elevational gradient. The combination of the measurements with new modeling capabilities will enable new understanding of ecohydrological feedbacks and have the potential to fundamentally change our ability to predict ecosystem response to climate change. <br/><br/>The mountain snowpack is the primary water source for 60 million people in the Western U.S. and one billion people globally. Recent changes in climate and vegetation cover (e.g. fire suppression, beetle infestation, fire) have potentially large, yet unrealized implications for snowmelt and water sustainability. Patterns of snow accumulation and snowmelt are highly variable in mountainous regions, varying with topography, climate, and vegetation. In mountain forests, the ecological impacts of potential changes in snowmelt and water availability are poorly known. The proposed research targets this knowledge gap using measurements of snow depth and other water-related variables in different types of mountain forests. The measurements will be used to improve models that estimate solar radiation and snowmelt, providing the tools needed to predict ecosystem response to changes in climate or land cover. In this regard, the project will improve understanding of the linkages between snowpack processes and land cover changes. The mountain snowpack is one of the most sensitive hydrologic states to changes in climate. Hence, the improved characterization of snowmelt will broadly address societal vulnerabilities to climate change. The new levels of understanding achieved in this research should have dramatic impacts on the research of others and the conceptual model by which snow covered forested systems are studied. For example, many biogeochemical and ecosystem models have parameterizations which represent the processes studied here. Hence the proposed work will broadly extend to collaborators working at the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site and other highland systems. Further, the distribution of snowmelt in these systems dominates water inputs and therefore exerts a strong control on the rate of soil erosion and mineral weathering, affording collaborations with the earth surface and geomorphology communities via NSF?s Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network ? with implications for cross-CZO research. Data from this project will be made available to these communities through multiple portals providing a direct link to these other activities.

This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the NSF Engineering Directorate (ENG) and the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE). This project is motivated by the long-standing prevalence of inactive waste sites resistant to the restoration of contaminated soil and groundwater. Recently, the National Research Council (NRC, 2012) identified thousands of complex sites, ""complex"" referring to a collection of physical, chemical, and regulatory factors that inhibit cleanup. Because the NRC committee was unable to identify potential technological breakthroughs, its report focused on the need for long-term management (LTM) of these sites, which will require many decades of cooperation between regulatory agencies, responsible parties, and host communities. While attention to LTM represents a progressive and positive development in the culture of groundwater restoration (GR), some compelling alternatives to LTM have not been fully evaluated, including: (1) a reinvigorated research agenda to develop cost-effective cleanup technologies, and (2) a paradigm shift from current practices (which emphasize technical analysis of health/cost tradeoffs) to a more holistic decision process informed by local stakeholder values and the core ideals of adaptive management, sustainability, environmental justice, and intergenerational equity. The INSPIRE team brings together scholars from environmental engineering, philosophy, sociology, and oral history to address important questions raised by the proposed shift to LTM: (1) to what extent has inadequate engineering implementation of remedial technologies contributed to failures to achieve cleanup targets (in contrast to the presumed inherent challenges of contaminated sites), (2) has the dominant risk-versus-cost paradigm adequately engaged the environmental values held by practitioners and stakeholders (including sustainability), (3) how has GR practice and policy development been shaped by group identify and differences in core values and beliefs among government regulators, responsible parties, technical professionals, citizens, and academic researchers, and (4) how should the concerns of community residents, who will be most affected by the transition to LTM, be appropriately engaged? Recognizing that the above questions are not easily addressed by disciplinary or ""expert panel"" research, this three-year INSPIRE project will emphasize the qualitative analysis of recorded audio data (RAD), collecting and analyzing 100-200 hours of RAD from focus groups, workshop dialogues, oral history testimonies, and phone interviews with a diverse community of professional, government, academic and citizen practitioners and stakeholders. Open-ended interviews are a well-established and appropriate vehicle to engage, study, and learn from the local, often undocumented, knowledge of the diverse communities that engage in complex projects such as GR. Using new database tools for thematically mapping anecdotal interviews as meaning-dense RAD, analytic methods such as frame analysis, applied collaboratively by the interdisciplinary team, will support the development of new decision paradigms for more effectively managing GR and complex waste sites. Disseminated results will include journal articles, practitioner-oriented workshops, and new tools to support collaborative scholarship. The project will advance the field of GR by critically examining the pervasive assumption that restoration to health-based levels is technological infeasible for most sites, and by assessing alternative paradigms such as reinvigorated basic research, adaptive management, and/or sustainability analysis. Two doctoral, one MS, and several undergraduate students will receive cutting-edge training in cross-disciplinary research. Furthermore, the experience of collaborative qualitative analysis of RAD data (by the entire research team working together) will constitute a new and potentially transformative model for research that fully integrates science, engineering, ethics, and policy."1034043,Influence of stormwater management structures on ecological function in urban streams,CBET,"ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, SPECIAL STUDIES AND ANALYSES, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH",9/1/10,8/26/13,Sara McMillan,NC,University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Standard Grant,Bruce K.

Landslides disrupt aquatic habitats and damage infrastructure (e.g., roads, utilities, dams). Landslide hazards in the west are expected to grow with climate change, but to date, geologic landslide research has been typically conducted independently from hydroclimate research. There is need for unifying these two lines of research to provide regional scale landslide prediction for resource management and climate adaptation strategies. Washington Cascade Mountains experience landslides across a wide a range of climates, vegetation, and topography, and thus, work done here is relevant to mountain areas across the globe. Working with state and federal agency partners, this project team will develop a regional-scale distributed numerical model in conjunction with 50+ years of landslide observations across the Washington Cascades to answer the following research questions: 1) What are the relative roles of location (geology, topography, slope) vs. climate (precipitation, temperature, snowmelt, and recharge rates) on landslide frequencies? 2) How well does a new, transformative model combining the methods of geotechnology, geology, and hydroclimate prediction reproduce past spatial-temporal patterns and frequencies of landslides? Specifically, a) Are probabilistic or deterministic methods more reliable? and b) In which cases are finer, more site-specific data needed (e.g., snow pack on mountainsides providing extra load and a key trigger for landslides, or freeze-thaw cycles changing soil stability) for accurate model performance. 3) How will climate change likely impact landslide locations and frequencies? Specifically, a) What are the largest expected hazards (e.g., road wash-out, sediment flux, culvert failure)? and b) Under these predictions, what decision support tools are needed for sustainable management of landscapes and streams over complex terrain? While the effects of climate change on water resources and stream temperatures have been extensively studied using numerical models in recent decades, only limited studies focused on landslide sediment delivery. These studies either use empirical rainfall thresholds and geologic susceptibility maps at regional scales to identify landslides, or focus on detailed hydrology over several meters. The first method excludes essential physics, while the second cannot be used over large areas. This project will integrate these two lines of thought and potentially transform how regional landslide research is done. The proposed model will pioneer an innovative numerical model design by combining subsurface flow recharge and surface runoff from an 5,500-m resolution land surface model (VIC) with a 10-m resolution probabilistic slope stability model (SINMAP). The work is targetedto directly impact resource management and will be incorporated into K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education. The research plan has been developed in close collaboration with state and federal agencies, who will immediately put results to use in land management. A workshop will be conducted in year 3 of the project to give model training to resource managers and share our final modeling framework with them. In conjunction with education professionals, an education module will be developed for high school students. This module will be presented at select schools in Seattle through the University of Washington's ""University in the Classroom project,"" wherein students receive university credit for high-level work. The findings of the project will contribute to undergraduate and graduate level teaching at the University of Washington."1243622,EAGER: Assessing the Impact of Technology-Aided Participation and Mentoring on Transformative Interdisciplinary Research,ACI,CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE,8/1/12,8/6/12,Cathy Davidson,NC,Duke University,Standard Grant,Kevin L.

The exemplar virtual institution studied is the Humanities, Arts, Sciences and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC or ""haystack""), a network of over 9000 educators dedicated to innovative, technology-aided forms of collaborative research and teaching. Formed in 2002, HASTAC, now headquartered at Duke University in the Ph.D. Lab in Digital Knowledge, is currently adding 200-300 new members a month. The study mobilizes six years of the extensive HASTAC data pool, including the 176MB MySQL database of individual and institutional member profiles, for social networking analysis, data extraction, text and content analysis, and procedural and organizational analysis. It provides critically needed evidence for the current and future capacities of institutions to support the interdisciplinary collaborations essential to meet the Grand Challenges (such as energy, water sustainability, or human sciences and policy design) confronting the world, especially those requiring collaboration among scientists working with humanists and social scientists trained to confront the societal and cultural factors that deter the implementation of scientific and technological solutions.<br/><br/>Given the unique interdisciplinary nature of HASTAC as a virtual organization and the fact that this is a first, exploratory study of its extensive, accessible, anonymized ""clean"" individual and institutional data (in a Drupal database), this is a transformative, high-impact early-stage study for which EAGER was designed. Because one focus of the study is the 522 current students and recent alumni (80% graduate, 20% undergraduate) in 63 disciplines and departments on small scholarships from over 120 supporting institutions, the study will also test the hypothesis that networked interdisciplinary young scholars outcompete more traditional peers, another first commensurate with the EAGER mission of transformative knowledge with the potential for maximum impact.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the project include modeling a method by which cyberfrastructure can enable successful collaborative research adaptable to other problem-based research centers and scalable to other projects, such as NSF-funded Science of Learning Centers (SLC); determining the best incentives for risk-taking early career interdisciplinary research; and calculating how voluntary, scholarly networking and virtual mentoring support and promote early-stage researchers in both scholarly innovation and high-prestige academic achievement.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the study is in addressing one of the most urgent structural problems in higher education and one on which there is little quantitative, data-based research: how to incentivize and support the range of cross-disciplinary researchers who must work together successfully in order to solve society?s biggest problems. At its broadest, it is anticipated that the study will intervene in current theories of organizational behavior, social media protocols, disciplinary and interdisciplinary formation, and self-governing systems, and lay the groundwork for increased collaborations dedicated to tackling the major problems and Grand Challenges of the 21st century."
