<Abstract>This comparative study uses ethnographic, interview, and content data analysis to provide a situated social and organizational comparison of three scientific projects with distinct approaches to developing cyberinfrastructures and achieving data interoperability. The three projects are GEON (http://www.geongrid.org), a geosciences project using a national distributed storage broker to create data sharing across multiple disciplines through developing shared ontologies; LTER (http://lternet.edu/), a long-term ecological program using metadata standards to federate data across a single discipline; and Ocean Informatics, an oceanographic team building community and designing a local metadata standard to bridge key data collections to a national standard. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Need: As new scientific cyberinfrastructures emerge, a central question is how to share data across multiple distributed organizational and social contexts. There have been many suggestions for technical fixes for this pressing concern (particularly important since some of today&amp;apos;s great political questions, such as preserving biodiversity and developing a sustainable relationship with the environment pivot on the ability to federate data across organizational and disciplinary contexts). However, there has been little study - and no comparative study - of the organizational and social dimensions of differing interoperability strategies. The working hypothesis for this project, drawing on research in the field of social informatics over the past fifteen years, is that creation of a common shared data infrastructure entails complex negotiations involving the relative institutional weight of the different actors (institutions have a range of motives for subscribing or not to interoperability strategies), the nature of their disciplinary organization (in particular reward structures; openness to interdisciplinary work; history of use of large datasets) and the nature of their domain work (degree of commitment to long-term data storage and re-use; decay rate of data over time; need to draw on large federate datasets). This study will develop grounded understandings of the organizational complexity in producing shared scientific cyberinfrastructure and the costs and benefits of three interoperability approaches: metadata standards, ontologies, and community-driven approaches. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impact: The development of scientific cyberinfrastructure is vital for this country&amp;apos;s future economic prosperity and for its ability to respond to key policy issues with scientific and technical dimensions. Cyberinfrastructure is a large-scale contemporary investment; this study will help inform the decisions that today are determining future structural outcomes. At the level of science policy, the project will facilitate understandings of the organizational and social dimensions in building shared infrastructure. The research will produce a policy white paper on data communities and scientific cyberinfrastructure and suggest guidelines for the ongoing formative evaluation of infrastructure development activities. As these new communication tools develop, there is a need for educational programs to sensitize domain scientists, computer scientists and science policy workers to social and organizational issues. The project will produce, as a centerpiece to a Masters level program in cyberinfrastructure, a graduate course about its development, as well as a secondary school lesson module for use in an educational partnership. A &amp;apos;Cyberinfrastructure Page&amp;apos; website, modeled on &amp;apos;Inquiry Page&amp;apos; (http://inquiry.uiuc.edu/), will incorporate the course and module and allow this project to share results first with the partner communities and then across communities. This will provide the kernel of a resource site for researchers and practitioners in the emergent field of scientific cyberinfrastructure, to share findings and best practices and to engage in collective problem solving.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is supported by an award from the FY 2004 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD). Coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards involves all NSF directorates and offices.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Cyber-ShARE Center will bring together experts in computer science, computational mathematics, education, earth science, and environmental science to address the challenge of providing information to scientists and other users of cyber-infrastructure (CI) that allows them to make informed decisions about the resources that they retrieve and to have confidence in using results from CI-based applications. The Cyber-ShARE team will conduct innovative research to facilitate the development of CI-based applications and increase their use by scientists by enhancing CI results with provenance information, trust recommendations, and uncertainty levels (areas that are recognized as essential for the success of CI); by creating scientist-centered tools and artifacts; and by contributing CI resources to appropriate CI portals. In addition, the synergistic and multi-disciplinary subprojects will advance knowledge in i) provenance to capture knowledge about uncertainty and trust using results from discipline experts; ii) the physical properties of the Earth by studying CI-based techniques and approaches for integrating data with varying accuracy and sensitivity; iii) optimization of data streams and sensor arrays in ecological and environmental networks by targeting improved characterization of environmental phenomena and processes.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Ontologies are developed to provide semantics for a particular domain and to support information retrieval, reasoning and knowledge discovery. However, as separate groups develop ontologies, there is a need to combine or match ontologies to support connecting information across heterogeneous sources. Ontology matching is a complicated process that stems from the need to involve several types of matching algorithms that take into account syntactic, lexical, structural, instance, and logic features of the ontologies. The current support provided to users to understand and evaluate the results provided by ontology matching systems is very limited; therefore ontology matching is an arduous and time consuming task. This exploratory project focuses on development of a novel approach to ontology matching that employs visual analytics to guide the users in the process. It is expected to result in increased quality of resulting ontologies while also reducing the time and effort of experts involved in ontology matching.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Visual analytics is at the confluence of information visualization, data analytics, and data transformation. This project explores the potential of visual analytics to effectively assist real-time decisions by domain experts and ontology researchers alike during the ontology matching process. The project is organized around three key research challenges:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) Visualization: Data and analytically extracted features need to be encoded into rich visualizations that can be effectively manipulated. In particular, visualizations should lend themselves well to complex transformations that facilitate the discernment of trends or patterns.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(2) Architecture: The interaction between the automatic matching and the visual analytics modules is central to the proposed approach. The envisioned architecture will support a quality-controlled feedback loop in which users will intervene to change the analytic and visual parameters of the system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(3) Performance evaluation: Performance measures will be developed to objectively identify the obtained gains in terms of the effort saved by users and of the quality of the matching results as enabled by the proposed visual analytics approach to ontology matching.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, this proof-of-concept project is expected to make a significant contribution in effective ontology matching that in turn will enable semantically enriched access to complex, heterogeneous, and distributed data to an increasing number of users in a variety of domains. Research results, including developed software, will be made available via the project web site (http://agreementmaker.org/wiki/index.php/Visual_Analytics). The project provides research experience to students and results from this research will be included in the computer science curriculum.</Abstract>

<Abstract>EIA- 0205111&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Eduard Hovy&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Information Sciences Institute, USC&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This grant will explore the automated construction of domain ontologies across governmental datasets. There are many &amp;quot;data silos&amp;quot; in government; that is, collections of data which cannot be cross-compared or queried. This is a major problem in presenting government information to consumers which is tailored according to their interests, rather than according to the organizational structure of government agencies. While such automated tools cannot completely construct accurate ontologies, they can take much of the labor intensiveness out of such efforts, particularly where the number of terms or variables is so large (in the thousands) as to prevent manual efforts. Working with the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has many datasets of interest to the public, the research team will develop a semi-automated toolkit to aid in the construction of ontologies.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Research Coordination Network (RCN) project supports the establishment of the RNA Ontology Consortium (ROC), which aims to create an integrating conceptual framework--an RNA Ontology (RO)--with which to understand RNA function in biological systems and to advance research in RNA biology, chemistry and genomics. This will require the integration of the research paradigms of chemists, molecular biologists, genomicists, information scientists and structural biologists, and will in turn require the creation of a common, dynamic, controlled vocabulary (the RO), pertaining to RNA function and based on RNA sequences, secondary and three-dimensional structures. Thus, the central objective of the ROC is to identify all RNA motifs mentioned in the literature or appearing in databases, to agree upon a definition for each motif and to write that definition down in a structured manner. This is very timely as knowledge about RNA accumulates and progresses rapidly. The purposes for creating the RO are therefore (1) to integrate sequence and structural databases and (2) to create powerful software tools that bring advanced computational methods to the bench scientist. In short, this will advance RNA science by turning diverse information and data accumulation into knowledge. To achieve these aims, ROC will foster communication and promote collaboration among RNA scientists by coordinating frequent face-to-face workshops to discuss, debate, and resolve difficult conceptual issues. These meeting opportunities will create new research directions at various levels of RNA research. At the RNA Society meeting each year, ROC working groups will report progress and obtain feedback from the wider community of RNA scientists. The broader impacts of the project will flow from the tangible products of the networking activities: (1) the RNA Ontology itself, (2) usefully linked databases, and (3) powerfully integrated software. The creation of the RO will facilitate communication and collaboration among the overlapping communities of scientists involved in various aspects of RNA science. Moreover, the RO will provide students and teachers of science at all levels with clear concepts for understanding the molecular basis of life, and the important roles played by RNA. The integration of disparate sources of information and the creation of integrated software and collaboration tools will expand and enhance the ability of bench scientists to interpret their experimental data and of computational biologists and genomicists to mine genomic data. The project will build on the experience of the core group in constructing the RNA mark-up language, RNAML, the structural mark-up language PDBML, a comprehensive classification of basepairing in RNA, as well as SCOR (Structural Classification of RNA) and the Riboweb project. The ROC will work closely with the Gene Ontology and Sequence Ontology communities to create a comprehensive integrated ontology pertaining to RNA and will make its work accessible on the World-Wide Web using servers hosted by Bowling Green State University. The Consortium has the support of the RNA Society to actively foster participation in its activities and to seek broad input for its work. The mechanism for actively promoting diverse participation will include active recruitment by the Coordinator and Steering Committee and dissemination of information regarding the ROC through the WWW and the email lists of the RNA Society and related professional societies. The ROC encourages the participation of all interested scientists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award was made to transform the current prototype of the Feeding Experiments End-user Database (FEED) into a data-rich, publicly-available source of physiological data on feeding in mammals that incorporates a novel ontology module. An important innovation is the development of five non-overlapping ontologies related to feeding behavior, function, and structure that will provide the constrained definitions of terms necessary to permit computational comparisons in analyses of phenotypic diversity. Ontology construction begins with an ontology workshop. Ontology and database development will be driven by a set of six use cases that comprise synthetic, phylogenetically-informed analyses aimed at understanding the integrated roles of physiology and morphology during a variety of feeding behaviors in mammals. The research will to initiate new collaborations involving FEED as a primary data source by engaging three scientific communities (reptile feeding physiologists, bioengineers, and developmental biologists) in a series of interdisciplinary use case development workshops. During the workshops, the project team will design and commence work on new use cases that will guide efforts to extend the infrastructure of FEED and permit synthetic studies that cut across traditional knowledge domains. This project is innovative because it generates a proof-of-concept database to facilitate understanding of the complexity and connectivity between behaviors, physiological mechanisms, and structures involved in mammalian feeding across multiple scales of organization, and because it includes work to insure that FEED is a tool that is extensible to other scientific communities.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts include development and public release of novel bioinformatic research infrastructure for physiology, a field that has traditionally been on the periphery of bioinformatics. This project promotes interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists across four knowledge domains. Training of undergraduate and graduate students in research on morphological and physiological analysis as well as database and ontology construction is an important focus. FEED will also be utilized as a teaching tool in bioinformatics courses aimed at undergraduate and graduate education in informatics. Dissemination of project outcomes and public access to the FEED database will be available at www.feedexp.org.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) has been involved in the development of Water Data Services (WDS) through the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information Systems (HIS) project. The vision for WDS is to bring together the nation&amp;apos;s (and, potentially, the earth&amp;apos;s) water data in a federated system of servers linked using a services-oriented architecture. CUAHSI WDS is used by both academic researchers and by government data providers at both the Federal and State levels. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A critical challenge in achieving this vision is understanding and reconciling structural and semantic differences across publishers of hydrologic data. The HIS project achieved interoperability between different data repositories by developing a common relational schema (Observations Data Model, ODM V1.1), an XML schema for exchanging hydrologic observations (Water Markup Language, WaterML V1.0), and a prototype ontology (V1.0) of hydrologic concepts that is used for data discovery purposes. Experience has shown that the prototypes for WaterML and the ontology are in need of further development. The prototype ontology provided semantic mediation among measured properties, but as this ontology was applied to more diverse data holdings, it became apparent that i) semantic heterogeneity continued to exist at various levels, including sampled media, sampling environment, chemical speciation, and units, that ii) the ontology needs to cover a wider range of parameters (such as those from the EPA Substance Registry System), and that iii) the development of semantic knowledge needs to be put on a much broader community base. WaterML has proven to be of great utility as a standardized way for transferring water information, but needs to be moved through a formalized standardization process. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will address the underlying semantic problem through the development of a more comprehensive, extensible ontology that harmonizes the more generic information model contained within ODM with those from various existing federal information sources. This includes the development of a community process for an evolving hydrologic ontology. In addition, WaterML, which has been adopted by USGS and NCDC, will be extended to reflect this more generic information model. The project will contribute to forming an international standard. The fundamental goal of the project is the organization of hydrologic concepts in a way that allows publishers to describe their data unambiguously and helps users to discover data easily yet with a precise understanding of the properties measured and their context.</Abstract>

This project records speakers in their cultural setting to preserve an understanding of their society. Language goes beyond serving as just a tool for members of a culture, serving as the essential vehicle through which all experience is interpreted, and the medium by which we understand the world we live in. The work digitizes, archives, and analyzes linguistic data to make it accessible, searchable, and interpretable to future generations and encourages not only the preservation of existing digital language documentation but also their creation and analysis. The infrastructure acquired will service the following goals: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Immediate development of a web portal for endangered languages that will eventually allow access to all language and cultural data in general,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Training and matriculation of students in language engineering and linguistics, and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Community outreach.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research is expected to create the first tool- and data-rich online web portal dedicated to preserving and providing access to documentation of endangered languages, developing tools for data integration, cross-language querying and linguistic analysis. The portal will support interdisciplinary research in ontology, data integration, multimedia data management, language engineering, and security.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impact: The project will facilitate the fusion of several disciplines within computer science and the arts and humanities with a single application focus. It will also contribute in establishing a multi-institutional doctoral degree and a graduate student certificate program in Language Engineering. Moreover, the portal will provide outreach support for field linguistics, serving as a source for students at all levels on minority languages and cultures, especially those that have been or are endangered.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Award: 0955816&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI: Nancy Weigand&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Project Title: Spatial Ontology Community of Practice: an Interdisciplinary Network to Support Geospatial Data Sharing, Integration and Interoperability (INTEROP)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Geospatial data, which describe location information for geographic features, are pervasive across many disciplines and fundamental for diverse applications, such as economic development, natural resources, environmental protection, and emergency response. But, re-using geospatial data remains difficult because of the heterogeneity. Although progress has been made by initiatives such as the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and Geospatial One-Stop to distribute data, it is now necessary to address issues of standards harmonization and agreement on the meanings of relevant concepts from diverse data sets due to the use of different community views. Semantic interoperability has been recognized as a stumbling block to collaboration needed by research communities. As a solution, well designed, formal ontologies, relying on agreements between communities on unambiguous representation of concepts and relationships for a given problem area, can be used as an analytic tool to bridge community gaps. Unfortunately, many communities lack the expertise to develop, test, and disseminate such ontologies on their own, and, further, common ontologies require agreement across a range of communities. The purpose of this Network is to create such opportunities for the geospatial community and extend the results to related communities. The Network can be considered as an umbrella over other more specific domains linked through the Network. The Network is based on an existing Spatial Ontology Community of Practice (SOCoP) network that already has a core group of active participants from academia, government, and industry. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Mechanisms for the Network include an on-line collaboration environment, a repository for geospatial ontologies with tools; educational and participatory workshops for a broad geospatial community to solicit input on use cases, smaller working group sessions on one or two chosen domains to collaborate on developing ontologies that work across use cases, and interactions with standards groups for formal publishing of ontologies, demonstrations, and research activities. The SOCoP INTEROP network will also provide training and outreach in cross-area standards, data-sharing, and information management in scientific and local communities by demonstrating the power of cooperative modeling of semantics. An educational component on geospatial ontologies will also be developed. The project will contribute to a model to incorporate semantics into the next phase of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure</Abstract>

<Abstract>Building a Unified Infrastructure for Data Integration on Political Violence and Conflict &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This proposal s a conceptualization project whereby leaders of several major data collections, along with experts in insurgency, ethnic conflict, terrorism, computer science, and data management, will build consensus around a unified infrastructure for political violence data collection and integration. The project will create a scalable ontology focused on four domains relevant to all forms of political violence: conflicts, actors, geographies, and events. This ontological infrastructure will allow researchers and policy makers who study political violence, including its etiology and consequences, to access and integrate existing data from the major political violence data collections currently collected at academic institutions and non-governmental organizations around the world. This infrastructure will also facilitate the development of new non-linear and semantic analytical methods to decipher the complex dynamics of conflict and violence. Finally, this infrastructure will provide a platform for the next generation of data collection on violence and conflict by creating a flexible framework for new data collection projects that is both easily exchangeable and adheres to the consensus-based ontologies developed. The proposed project incorporates a two-day stakeholder workshop, a schematic design of the ontological infrastructure for political violence data collection, and a web-based community-moderated issue-tracking wiki to encourage participatory development and refinement of the ontologies. Additionally, the proposed project supports one of the core missions of NSF?s Big Data initiative, focusing on the development of a data infrastructure relevant to national security. Intellectual Merit: Although scientists have made major advances in the empirical understanding of political violence in recent years, nonetheless further advances are being hindered by the fact that leading projects from around the world are largely autonomous and uncoordinated. This project will address this weakness by creating a scalable ontology focused on domains critical to political violence. The major goal of this enterprise is to design a strategy for integrating the world?s most important data bases on political violence within an expandable platform that will allow not only updating original data but the addition of new data and variables, including rapidly evolving data sets derived from the social media. The proposal has built in sufficient resources to host a two-day stakeholder conference, to prepare read-ahead materials for stakeholders before the conference, to design and staff a wiki for reaching out to the research community and for developing a final report that will serve as a springboard for a proposal to implement the ontology designed. By integrating the major data bases, providing an infrastructure for growth, and making the end product available to the world?s research community, the proposed activity could have a transformative impact on the science of political violence. Broader Impacts: This ontological approach to political violence data collection will offer critical insights for data integration and for advancing the scientific study of violent conflict. Effective identification of ontologies across major political violence data collections will provide an essential roadmap for the integration of these data structures and the development of new applications and analysis for research on national security. Additionally, the workshop will serve to network senior and junior faculty alongside graduate students thereby developing a new generation of political violence experts. The translation of the workshop report into a community-moderated and web-based issue-tracking wiki will serve to expand participation to include other researchers who will be instrumental in defining and shaping a larger ontological structure for both existing and future data collection efforts.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The objective of the research is to design, prototype, and assess a Geospatial Semantic Web framework to search, access, retrieve, integrate, and visualize geographic information at the feature level, using transportation network data as a case study. This research intends to advance the state of art of data-sharing from the current file level to feature level, which involves data elements represented by points, lines, or polygons at particular locations. Geospatial data sharing and exchange are essential to increase the efficiency of data-intensive applications and to reduce the redundancy of data acquisition. Yet current methods of sharing data at the file level make data sharing and exchange difficult because of the incompatibility of the variety of semantics, data models, structures and formats used at different systems. Data sharing at the file level is not necessary for many applications such as emergency responses and location based services, in which only information at or surrounding a particular location are needed. Therefore it is useful and necessary to build a feature-level data sharing system to meet the demand of many time critical applications that need real-time access and exchange of the most up-to-date spatial data. This research will design and prototype an interoperable Geospatial Semantic Web using standard technologies such as web services, semantic web, and ontology. The basic approach is to serve geospatial data as individual web services, and then enable these services in a Geospatial Semantic Web. Each web service is described and published in a service broker, which keeps a list of available services and the data items each service contains through ontologies. The end user can search for geospatial data elements from the service broker through services and ontologies. Based on the research, two transportation domain ontologies will be created and integrated using the Web Ontology Language. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The resulting system will fundamentally change traditional ways of data sharing, search and access. It will enable users or applications to semantically search and automatically discover and access feature level data. Furthermore, it may have important impacts on time-critical and data-intensive applications such as those used in homeland security, emergency response, location based services, urban planning, and decision-support systems. This research wishes to promote and advance research interests in the integration of Web services, ontology, and Geospatial Semantic Web. It attempts to show that the developed Geospatial Semantic Web can become a vendor-neutral, interoperable Web that allows geospatial data providers to advertise their data, allows end users such as the emergency response dispatchers to search, access, retrieve, and integrate different spatial information surrounding a particular location from multiple sources through Web Services.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This proposal is supported in part by the Methodology, Measurement and Statistics program.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many distributed data and knowledge base applications call for a structured &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;approach to collaborative construction of large ontologies &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(conceptualizations of objects, properties, and relationships between &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;objects of interest in specific domains). This high risk, potentially high &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;impact research is aimed at addressing the need of such applications for &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ontology languages, distributed reasoning algorithms, and software tools &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that support rapid collaborative assembly and use of complex ontologies &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;through partial and selective reuse of independently created ontology &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;modules. A family of description logics (DL) based modular ontology &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;languages, namely Package-Based Description logics (P-DL) being developed by &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the researchers to explore the language features, syntax, and semantics of &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;package-based partial order ontologies (PPO). The resulting tools will be &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;evaluated in the context of collaborative construction of animal trait &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(phenotype) ontologies needed for comparative genomics. Anticipated results &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of the research include open source software for rapid, collaborative &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;construction of PPO (and eventually, P-DL ontologies). The resulting tools &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;can potentially transform distributed data and knowledge base applications &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in the same way in which the World-Wide Web transformed the construction, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;sharing and use of hyperlinked documents and Wiki has transformed &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;encyclopedia construction. Broader impacts of this research include enhanced &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;opportunities for research-based training of graduate and undergraduate &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;students, enhanced interdisciplinary collaborations, increased participation &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of under-represented groups, and engagement of the broader scientific &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;community in developing and using increasingly sophisticated collaborative &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ontology development tools.

<Abstract>The University of Missouri-Rolla is awarded a grant to create an ontology of amphibian morphology by enlisting a blend of manual and semi-automated approaches to mine electronic media for instances of potential concepts and properties. This research will be carried out jointly with the University of Kansas. The ontology will enable disassociated research groups to overcome differences in three commonly used anatomical lexicons derived from research on each distinct order. The resulting ontology will be accessed through the web and through an application programming interface. An advisory board and outreach workshops will be organized to promote community engagement in the development and ultimate maintenance of the ontology. Because ontologies can be understood by both software agents and humans, they are an ideal vehicle for information exchange, creating the foundation for integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines. Currently, the development of most ontologies requires large amounts of manual effort. Semi-automated generation of ontologies will substantially decrease the amount of human effort required in the process. This project will demonstrate this approach in the domain of amphibian morphology with the expectation that it will be potentially applicable to many other domains. Because the meta-data inherent in ontologies allow for universal information exchange, expediting the process of ontology development will be instrumental to fully realizing a Semantic Web.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Understanding and sustaining the natural world in the 21st century depends on improving our capacity to access ecological, earth science, and human-dimension data; mining these data for new knowledge; and conveying new insights to decision-makers and the general public. Computer science and information technology research can effectively address many of these issues and advance our ability to conduct ecological science. This multidisciplinary research investigation will create a &amp;quot;Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge&amp;quot; (SEEK)-an information technology framework and infrastructure that will be used to derive and extend ecological knowledge by facilitating the discovery, access, integration, interpretation, and analyses of distributed ecological information. SEEK will provide for the integration of local desktop data with a larger network of data and analytical tools, enabling ecologists and other researchers to tackle complex research problems that were hitherto intractable. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The SEEK initiative stands on the foundation of substantial and productive NSF investment in ecological and biodiversity informatics and it brings together four highly collaborative, forward-looking institutions in a partnership committed to inventing and supporting a global computing infrastructure for environmental biology. The project involves a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, ecologists and technologists from the Partnership for Biodiversity Informatics (PBI), a consortium comprising the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS); the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC); the University of Kansas (KU), and the University of New Mexico (UNM)) and partnering institutions (Arizona State University, University of North Carolina, University of Vermont, and Napier University in Scotland).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This five-year initiative will lead to fundamental improvements in how researchers can 1) gain global access to data and information, 2) rapidly locate and utilize distributed computational services, and 3) exercise powerful new methods for capturing, reproducing, and extending the analysis process itself. SEEK will also specifically provide ecologists and other researchers access to a large-scale network of information resources and computational services, via powerful data discovery and analysis tools that operate from desktop computers. These capabilities will significantly build research capacity to more effectively address global research, management and policy issues in environmental biology that increasingly require much more efficient, automated access to distributed and heterogeneous data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A multi-faceted approach will be employed to insure that the research products, software, and information technology infrastructure resulting from SEEK optimally benefit science, education, and the public. Outreach includes community involvement, a WWW portal, informatics training, and an innovative annual symposium and training program that focuses on information technology transfer to young investigators and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In the information economy, access to information for knowledge creation and decision-making is as valuable as the information itself. This project will enable bringing the intellectual content of biodiversity and ecological information into currency for science and society. Examples of significant project outcomes include: (i) revolutionizing discovery, access to and integration of ecological, earth, and human dimension data and information through the SEEK infrastructure; (ii) developing intelligent analytical tools and infrastructure to support the needs of scientists, decision-makers, and the general public; (iii) education and training of the next generation of ecologists in information technology skills; and (iv) improving the opportunities for scientists, resource managers, policy makers, and the public to make scientifically-informed decisions about the environment by expanding access to ecological data, information, and knowledge.</Abstract>

The goal is to develop an ontology that can specify both lower-level cellular models and higher-level tissue, organ and systems models in a manner that is most useful for modeling and simulation. The workshop is organized to specify requirements for the ontology, based on existing models such as the Digital Anatomist Foundation Model of Rosse et al and the emerging BioSPICE ontology. An initial draft of a unified ontology that extends from gross anatomy to cellular components and a detailed plan for converting this draft into a system that can be widely accepted by the research community and can serve as the basis for developing interoperable simulations and other representations of these systems is in preparation. The draft is being prepared by the principle investigators supported by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, prior to the workshop that will provide an in-depth peer review of the proposed ontology and the plan for next steps&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A final document being generated by the participants will be a concrete action plan for establishing a framework though which existing ontologies may be unified, expanded and enhanced. As a result, unification of cell-organ ontologies is enhancing the ability of researchers and developers to prepare interoperable simulation models in biomedicine, leading to advancement of our understanding of multiple levels of biological structure and function.</Abstract>

<Abstract>It is a challenge to define the ontology of social and institutional reality within a framework which does justice to the surrounding physical environment of society and its institutions. This award will support a workshop on land, property and social ontology that will advance our knowledge and understanding of social processes and their outcomes. It is rooted in the idea that the transformation of land into property is a fundamental social process that has been hitherto neglected in the sciences of society, and that land and land ownership play a vital role in the establishment of capitalism and in economic development, especially in less-developed countries. The workshop will bring philosopher John Searle and economist Hernando De Soto together with a multidisciplinary group of leading experts on the topic, to discuss current developments in our understanding of social institutions and economic development in the particular context of land. Searle and De Soto have both recently authored books that have had broad impact within and outside of academia. Searle&amp;apos;s The Construction of Social Reality has advanced a new way of understanding human society and its institutions, while de Soto&amp;apos;s The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else has caused a small revolution in thinking about land, capital, and development. Searle is an internationally prominent philosopher whose works have had considerable impact also in disciplines such as linguistics, computer science, and the social sciences. De Soto is President of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy based in Lima. He works as a consultant to governments throughout Latin America and (currently) in the Middle East. While Searle and de Soto are personally acquainted, and while de Soto&amp;apos;s Mystery of Capital was itself in part influenced by Searle&amp;apos;s ideas on social ontology, the two have never appeared together in public. The present workshop will bring these two highly creative individuals together in such a way as to provide an open forum for examining the implications of their views for our understanding of economic development and of the ways in which different social institutions may hinder or facilitate such development. Additional experts have been invited to contribute their views on these questions and to develop contributions to the new social ontology which, through the work of Searle and de Soto, is currently in process of being established. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The workshop will provide valuable perspectives on the role of land information systems in the establishment of working market institutions and in the nurturing of economic and legal rights in less developed countries. Explicit formal accounts of the ontology of a domain are a critical foundation for adequate tools for information management systems, and this meeting will contribute to the development of such an ontology for the domain of land, the cadaster, and property law in general. The workshop also will contribute to the development of an ontology of other aspects of social reality at geographic scales. An edited book consisting of papers prepared for and presented at the meeting will promote the broader impact of the project. Early career scholars from several disciplines will benefit directly from their participation. On the last day, there will be sessions to identify priorities for future research on the topic. Lastly, the project will make efforts to promote the practical application of the results in Latin America and elsewhere.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Wireless communication is essential for coordination of emergency&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;response efforts. However, the various kinds of unit (fire, police,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;FBI and unattended sensors) do not necessarily have access to common&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;radio architectures. To achieve high levels of flexibility and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;scalability for wireless communication, the processing of the wireless&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;waveforms must be performed in software: i.e., &amp;quot;software&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;radio&amp;quot;. Migrating algorithms from hardware to software can increase&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the level of functionality but only if the communication protocols are&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;established at run time. We propose an approach to establishing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;communication by explicitly maintaining self-awareness and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;communication of knowledge about the operation of the communication&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;nodes. The self-awareness and communication of knowledge is based on&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the maintenance of an explicit, declarative knowledge base or&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;quot;ontology&amp;quot; of communication. Hence, we refer to the concept as&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Ontology Based Radio&amp;quot; (OBR). An ontology captures the basic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;terminology (concepts) of the domain of interest and the relationships&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;among the concepts. Ontologies can be expressed in the DARPA Agent&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Markup Language (DAML), and processed either off-line using a theorem&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;prover or in real time using an expert system engine. The main idea&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of OBR is that the communication nodes ``understand&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the contents of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information to be transferred, their own capabilities and capabilities&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of the destination units. The goal of the proposed project is to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;develop a proof of concept that demonstrates optimized dynamic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interoperability between different kinds of communication node,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;especially unattended sensors as well as radios used by emergency&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;response teams.</Abstract>

An ontology is a semantic model that contains a shared vocabulary and classification of concepts in a domain. Ontologies for biology are crucial in data integration from multiple databases and in literature mining for knowledge extraction and evidence attribution. This project focuses on the development of an ontology of protein names, consisting of a data dictionary and links to more specific, more general and synonymous protein names. Ontology development, however, currently requires substantial human effort. This project will exploit statistical and computational linguistics methods to induce an ontology of protein names using text corpora from MEDLINE and a knowledge base developed at the Protein Information Resource (PIR); terms in the induced ontology will also be linked to the functional hierarchy of the Gene Ontology. The induced ontology can then be further edited by a human. This project aims at demonstrating that this domain-independent method of ontology induction is more cost-effective than having humans develop an ontology from scratch. The approach could therefore be of practical value in other domains where there is a need to develop ontologies linking text corpora and nomenclature in databases. Both the ontology and software system developed in this project will be freely distributed to the scientific community via the PIR web site in standard XML-based ontology interchange formats and for intelligent literature mining and PubMed searching.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The over-availability of data and the under-availability of knowledge present a critical challenge for biological informatics in the years to come. Clearly, effective techniques are need not only for storage and retrieval purposes, but also for mining genomic data to increase our knowledge. However, the high dimensionality and enormous size of genomic data pose very challenging problems in analysis and visualization of the data sets. This project investigates novel approaches to analyzing gene expression data and integrating them into biological research. New algorithms and tools that can be used iteratively and interactively to mine the data will be developed. The strategies include a meta data hierarchy for integration of heterogeneous data, cluster-based indexing for high-dimensional data, inter-dimensional analysis for classification, and dynamic interactive visualization for pattern analysis. The approaches will be field-tested by biologists investigating an organism&amp;apos;s phenotype and genotype iterations. The project will deliver a flexible, scalable workbench environment ready to be used for general genomic data analysis. In addition to education development activities, the project&amp;apos;s impact will be enhanced by &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;broad applications in other fields that handle large-scale multi-dimensional data sets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This grant provides funding to investigate an information management infrastructure to support the planning and development of families of engineered products and systems for mass customization. The research will be conducted by a multi-university team comprised of faculty from the Pennsylvania State University, Bucknell University, the University of Missouri-Rolla, and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. The research will address three information technology challenges that include an information management infrastructure, a graphical modeling environment, and an agent-based synthesis framework to support product family planning and customization. First, a generalized information management infrastructure will be developed to facilitate capturing information regarding component sharing and reuse within a family of products. Next, a graphical modeling environment will be created to facilitate product family planning and construction, requirements specification, and customer preference capture. Finally, an agent-based synthesis framework will be developed to help configure platform concepts and customized variants within a product family. The research will be conducted in collaboration with industrial and government partners that include Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney, General Motors, Apprentice Systems, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results of this research will expand the utilization of information technology across engineering by developing a novel approach for managing design information related to product family planning for mass customization. The work will extend current representation and interoperability standards for product design repositories. The theoretical foundations developed for product family planning and information management will provide the basic framework for the development of an experimental prototype graphical modeling environment to test the validity of the proposed representation and agent-based synthesis methods. This modeling environment will also contribute to the development of integrated and interactive solution procedures for product family planning and synthesis. The project also has an educational component to it. The grant will foster undergraduate and graduate student exchanges between the four universities that are involved in this research, and projects based on the proposed research will be integrated within six undergraduate and six graduate courses at the four universities. Technology transfer will also occur with the industrial partners involved in the research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The primary objective of this proposal is to conceptualize, design, develop and demonstrate an approach using semantics to integrate engineering applications for design evaluations in a manner that can adapt to changing situations and needs. We classify opportunities for adaptive design evaluations into three categories: viewpoint adaptivity, composition adaptivity, and deployment adaptivity. Unfortunately, most ensembles of engineering software tools for design evaluations are not adaptive; furthermore there are few general frameworks and approaches for enabling this adaptivity. Unlike existing approaches that use unified data model to represent the data through out the entire product lifecycle, our approach is to build a distributed ontology-based knowledge system in an integration framework. This is based on building concepts into ontologies for each domain and interfacing actual data and ontologies, so that users working in different areas can use concepts and terminologies within his/her own expertise to describe the design semantics. In parallel, the approach will include support for composition adaptivity for evaluations that require different ensembles of applications and deployment strategies. Thus, all three important adaptivity opportunities will be addressed in a unified manner. Our approach, coined OADE (Ontology-based Adaptive Design Evaluation), will have as components representation tools, ontology builders, ontology projecting tools, custom tools, and communication tools. A prototype implementation will be created using technologies such as OWL (representation tool), Jena (ontology builder), Protege (ontology editor), JAVA, JDK, .NET ( communication tools) to demonstrate the approach for a sample scenario consisting of a virtual assembly system and a CAD system. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The overall benefits to society from this project include a viable method to integrate some of the most promising design tools in a disciplined and synergistic manner to get great improvements in productivity and reduction of waste due to untenable designs, and the creation of a competent workforce capable of adopting state-of-the-art technologies.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Understanding and sustaining the natural world in the 21st century depends on improving our capacity to access ecological, earth science, and human-dimension data; mining these data for new knowledge; and conveying new insights to decision-makers and the general public. Computer science and information technology research can effectively address many of these issues and advance our ability to conduct ecological science. This multidisciplinary research investigation will create a &amp;quot;Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge&amp;quot; (SEEK)-an information technology framework and infrastructure that will be used to derive and extend ecological knowledge by facilitating the discovery, access, integration, interpretation, and analyses of distributed ecological information. SEEK will provide for the integration of local desktop data with a larger network of data and analytical tools, enabling ecologists and other researchers to tackle complex research problems that were hitherto intractable. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The SEEK initiative stands on the foundation of substantial and productive NSF investment in ecological and biodiversity informatics and it brings together four highly collaborative, forward-looking institutions in a partnership committed to inventing and supporting a global computing infrastructure for environmental biology. The project involves a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, ecologists and technologists from the Partnership for Biodiversity Informatics (PBI), a consortium comprising the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS); the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC); the University of Kansas (KU), and the University of New Mexico (UNM)) and partnering institutions (Arizona State University, University of North Carolina, University of Vermont, and Napier University in Scotland).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This five-year initiative will lead to fundamental improvements in how researchers can 1) gain global access to data and information, 2) rapidly locate and utilize distributed computational services, and 3) exercise powerful new methods for capturing, reproducing, and extending the analysis process itself. SEEK will also specifically provide ecologists and other researchers access to a large-scale network of information resources and computational services, via powerful data discovery and analysis tools that operate from desktop computers. These capabilities will significantly build research capacity to more effectively address global research, management and policy issues in environmental biology that increasingly require much more efficient, automated access to distributed and heterogeneous data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A multi-faceted approach will be employed to insure that the research products, software, and information technology infrastructure resulting from SEEK optimally benefit science, education, and the public. Outreach includes community involvement, a WWW portal, informatics training, and an innovative annual symposium and training program that focuses on information technology transfer to young investigators and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In the information economy, access to information for knowledge creation and decision-making is as valuable as the information itself. This project will enable bringing the intellectual content of biodiversity and ecological information into currency for science and society. Examples of significant project outcomes include: (i) revolutionizing discovery, access to and integration of ecological, earth, and human dimension data and information through the SEEK infrastructure; (ii) developing intelligent analytical tools and infrastructure to support the needs of scientists, decision-makers, and the general public; (iii) education and training of the next generation of ecologists in information technology skills; and (iv) improving the opportunities for scientists, resource managers, policy makers, and the public to make scientifically-informed decisions about the environment by expanding access to ecological data, information, and knowledge.</Abstract>

<Abstract>0545472&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Hadizadeh&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This study uses microstructural characteristics of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) phase II and III core samples to test specific fault gouge evolution models. These working models are based on a large number of previous field and experimental studies of exhumed fault rocks, simulated fault gouge experiments, and numerical simulations of gouge deformation as well as theoretical considerations of brittle rock deformation and rock friction. The data collection, observations, analyses, and knowledge management are carried out by collaborative teamwork from campuses in the U.S.A. (University of Louisville and Georgia State University), Norway (PGP, University of Oslo), and Italy (University of Padova). The primary questions being investigated are as follows.1. Do gouges undergo a cyclic mechanical behavior while continuous comminution tends to reduce the particle size? If so, how are these processes reflected in the long-term seismic behavior of fault systems? 2. What is the physics of particle size reduction and strain localization in rock gouges? 3. What mechanisms in addition to brittle fracture play a critical role? 4. What proportion of seismic energy is used in gouge particle fracture? The applied methodologies include quantitative microstructural analysis using electron microscopy, analytical techniques, customized image analysis and numerical simulations as well as sub-seismic velocity frictional sliding experiments on the SAFOD gouge samples. The results are available on the Worldwide Web, from several integrated databases and domain ontologies that are being developed and implemented specifically for this project. Results are also being presented and published in scientific conferences and periodicals. These databases and knowledge bases, hosted on a node of the GEON (Geosciences Network) grid (www.geongrid.org) are also accessible from the EarthScope webpage.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A Video Indexing Ontology Using Fuzzy Metadata&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Video has been very difficult to understand by a machine. While humans&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;have a seemingly &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; way of seeing something and understanding a&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;scene in terms of background, foreground objects, and motions, video&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;understanding has been one of the perplexing problems of automatic video&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and image analysis to date.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project proposes a &amp;quot;divide and conquer&amp;quot; approach, where several&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;hundred general-purpose concepts (e.g., outdoors, animals) will be used&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to describe and annotate a very large universe of scenes commonly&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;depicted in video. Analogously to a limited vocabulary set of indexing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;terms one might find in a library card catalog, each video scene can be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;annotated through a combination of these concepts (&amp;quot;metadata&amp;quot;). To go&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;beyond a mere listing of objects, actions and scenes visible in the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;video, carefully chosen concepts also allow the description of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;relationships between them (&amp;quot;ontology&amp;quot;), which allows for much richer&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;composite descriptions. The challenge will be to define these concepts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;so that they satisfy several criteria at once:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;* The concepts must represent things frequently visible in video&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;broadcasts.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;* The concepts must be clearly identifiable to give computer&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;algorithms a chance to detect them automatically.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;* The concepts must be linkable into an ontology that defines how&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;concepts are related.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Since video annotations, whether done by a computer or a human, always&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;will contain errors, this work will incorporate probabilistic confidence&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;metrics (&amp;quot;fuzzy metadata&amp;quot;) into the annotation. No existing indexing and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;classification schemes have explicitly defined standards for measuring&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and reporting errors and omissions of indexing annotations; since&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;librarians and archivists have traditionally assumed that an index&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;contains only complete, trusted and verified metadata.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Furthermore, the project will assess to what extent these concepts can&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;be automatically extracted with state of the art video analysis&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques. Using footage from documentaries and television news, the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;project will perform video search and retrieval experiments to determine&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the usefulness of the ontology and the confidence of the annotations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;URL: http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/ontology</Abstract>

<Abstract>Research in search techniques was a critical component of the first generation of the Web, and has gone from academe to mainstream. A second generation &amp;quot;Semantic Web&amp;quot; is being built by adding semantic annotations that machines can understand and from which humans can benefit. Modeling, discovering and reasoning about complex relationships on the Semantic Web will enable this vision and transform the hunt for documents into a more automated analysis enabled by semantic technology. The beginnings of this shift from search to analysis can be observed in research and industry as users look beyond finding relevant documents based on keywords to finding actionable information leading to decision making and insights. Large scale semantic annotation of data (both domain-independent and domain-specific) is now possible because of an accumulation of advances in entity identification, automatic classification, taxonomy and ontology development, and metadata extraction. The next frontier, which fundamentally changes the way we acquire and use knowledge, is to automatically identify complex relationships between entities in this semantically annotated data. Instead of a search engine that returns documents containing terms of interest, there will be a system that returns actionable information (with the associated sources and supporting evidence) to a user or application. The user interacts with information universe through a hypothesis driven approach that combines search and inferencing, enabling more complex analysis and deeper insight. The research will focus on the design, prototyping and evaluation of a system, called SemDIS (Semantic Discovery) that supports indexing and querying of complex semantic relationships and is driven by notions of information trust and provenance and models of hypotheses and arguments under investigation. Such a capability greatly enhances the capacity of intelligence analysts to obtain (in time) information leading to a more secure homeland and world. Corresponding to the breadth and depth of the topics involved in the challenge undertaken, this is a collaborative project involving researchers at UGA&amp;apos;s LSDIS lab and UMBC. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;SemDIS will have broader impacts beyond the education and training of graduate students, and the publication of research findings. Results from the research will be integrated with courses, both existing and new. Institutional mechanisms in place will seek participation of students from underrepresented groups. The work will also gain from several academic-industry collaborations of the investigators. There will be an opportunity to leverage commercial infrastructure and raw metadata provided by Semagix. The researchers will collaborate with industry, and the students will be encouraged to intern at collaborating industrial labs. Within a broader social context, emerging knowledge-centric technologies raise legitimate privacy and civil liberties concerns. Building upon past policy making experience, the investigators will comment on potential implications of their scientific progress. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;More information can be found at http://http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/SemDIS/ and at http://www.cs.umbc.edu/SemDIS/</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many information workers are swamped with unfamiliar collections of text. One challenge is to obtain an accurate overview of a large text collection, such as the public comments collected in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;notice and comment&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; rulemaking. No single tool currently provides a sufficiently diversified picture of such a corpus, and no adequate theory exists to help people explore and form a deep and nuanced understanding of such a text collection. This research seeks to develop a computational framework that allows further exploration of this problem from multiple, integrated perspectives. All the assembled perspectives will be brought together into a single overall supra-document structure that is dynamically constructed under user guidance. In this structure, hierarchical topic clusters will be cross-linked by opinion and argumentation links, using two classes of text analysis engines: one for topics and subtopics, and the other for argument structures. The research team will design, develop, build, and systematically test an overall text exploration framework, an application to support federal regulation writersone called the Rule-Writers Workbench. There is a strong collaboration with Federal government officials who will provide data and participate in user testing. The three PIs have successfully collaborated on a related project under previous NSF funding. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit: This is a sustainable collaboration between computer science and political/social science research, rooted in a challenging and important real world application and informed by years of end user research. Dynamic, user-driven subtopic definition and clustering algorithms coupled with&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;language modeling are an innovative yet reachable set of goals. The framework to be developed will be grounded in the humanities disciplines&amp;apos;&amp;apos; expertise in rhetoric, discourse structure, and subjectivity.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: The Rule-Writers Workbench will allow federal government regulation writers to employ a suite of technical tools that perform independent analyses of public responses to proposed regulations, including near-duplicate detection and clustering, user-based topic selection from dynamically extracted keywords, opinion identification, and subtopic clustering. These capabilities will open new avenues for federal comment analysis.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The video analysis community has long attempted to bridge the gap from low-level feature extraction to semantic understanding and retrieval. One important barrier impeding progress is the lack of infrastructure needed to construct useful semantic concept ontologies, building modules to extract features from the video, interpreting the semantics of what the video contains, and evaluating the tasks against benchmark truth data. To solve this fundamental problem, this project will create a shared community resource around large video collections, extracted features, video segmentation tools, scalable semantic concept lexicons with annotations, ontologies relating the concepts to each other, tools for annotation, learned models and complete software modules for automatically describing the video through concepts, and finally a benchmark set of user queries for video retrieval evaluation.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The resource will allow researchers to build their own image/video classifiers, test new low-level features, expand the concept ontology, and explore higher level search services, etc., without having to redevelop several person year?s worth of infrastructure.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Using this tool suite and reference implementation, researchers can quickly customize concept ontologies and classifiers for diverse subdomains.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The contribution of the proposed work lies in the development of a large number of critical research resources for digital video analysis and searching. The modular architecture of the proposed resources provides great flexibility in adding new ontologies and testing new analytics components developed by other researchers in different domains. The use of large diverse standardized video datasets and well-defined benchmark procedures ensures a rigorous process to assess scientific progress.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results will facilitate rapid exploration of new ideas and solutions, contributing to advancements of major societal interest, such as next-generation media search and security.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;URL: http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/analyticsLibrary</Abstract>

<Abstract>The video analysis community has long attempted to bridge the gap from low-level feature extraction to semantic understanding and retrieval. One important barrier impeding progress is the lack of infrastructure needed to construct useful semantic concept ontologies, building modules to extract features from the video, interpreting the semantics of what the video contains, and evaluating the tasks against benchmark truth data. To solve this fundamental problem, this project will create a shared community resource around large video collections, extracted features, video segmentation tools, scalable semantic concept lexicons with annotations, ontologies relating the concepts to each other, tools for annotation, learned models and complete software modules for automatically describing the video through concepts, and finally a benchmark set of user queries for video retrieval evaluation.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The resource will allow researchers to build their own image/video classifiers, test new low-level features, expand the concept ontology, and explore higher level search services, etc., without having to redevelop several person year?s worth of infrastructure.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Using this tool suite and reference implementation, researchers can quickly customize concept ontologies and classifiers for diverse subdomains.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The contribution of the proposed work lies in the development of a large number of critical research resources for digital video analysis and searching. The modular architecture of the proposed resources provides great flexibility in adding new ontologies and testing new analytics components developed by other researchers in different domains. The use of large diverse standardized video datasets and well-defined benchmark procedures ensures a rigorous process to assess scientific progress.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results will facilitate rapid exploration of new ideas and solutions, contributing to advancements of major societal interest, such as next-generation media search and security.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;URL: http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/analyticsLibrary</Abstract>

<Abstract>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. William Lewis will lead a team conducting eighteen months of research on linguistic ontology development and text mining. The project, with the help of Dr. Scott Farrar, will expand an existing linguistic ontology through extensive text mining of linguistic data structures that exist on the Web, focusing specifically on interlinear text found mostly in scholarly articles. Central to the text mining task will be the development of a set of programming tools for accessing and deploying the ontology. The ontology will guide the text mining in interpreting the data found on the Web, and the text mining will be used cyclically to develop the ontology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;As more and more linguistic data has been placed on the Web, the need for locating, accessing, and comparing these data resources has become essential to the discipline. Unfortunately, because the terminology used by various researchers differs, access to resources can be limited or difficult, and comparison across resources is generally not possible. A linguistic ontology represents a way of encoding the knowledge space of the field as a computational artifact that makes possible the automated comparison of resources, irrespective of the terminology in which these resources are encoded. Text mining of linguistic resources is an essential part of the proposed research, because it can allow a comprehensive picture of linguistic knowledge to develop, and when applied to ontology construction, can be used to make the ontology more &amp;quot;data-aware.&amp;quot; Further, the development of programming tools to access the ontology will have the added benefit of making the ontology more readily accessible to other researchers wishing to use it, laying the foundations for a Semantic Web for linguistics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of geographic objects and associated cognitive categories. This will be achieved through the development of a formal ontology, which in turn will be based on rigorous, cross-linguistic empirical research using human subjects. Preliminary studies have indicated that geographic objects have important ontological features distinct from those of objects encountered at table-top scales, and that these features are salient for purposes of categorization. Evidence regarding the nature of cognitive categories has up to now been based primarily on studies of categorization of entities at scales similar to the human body and its parts--small animals and plants, artifacts and tools, etc.. The present project is the first to extend inquiries of this sort in systematic fashion to the domain of geographic objects. It thus has the potential to contribute to our understanding of human cognitive categorization in general, as well as to specific features of cognition in the geographic realm. Parallel studies will be conducted in several languages and regions, so that the resulting ontology will be multilingual.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will contribute to the development of geographic information systems (GIS), especially to spatial data transfer and semantic interoperability of geographic software and data. Most current GISs, and spatial data infrastructures, are based on geographic objects (entities), and an improved theory of the nature of geographic objects and their categories will improve the effectiveness of feature coding schemes that are a key part of geographic data. The multilingual aspects of the research will contribute to international geographic information exchange, and to the effectiveness of multinational projects in environmental, social, military, and commercial domains. The proposed research can be of practical importance in at least the following ways: (1) It can help us to understand how different groups of people exchange, or fail to exchange, geographic information. (2) It can support the development of knowledge-interchange standards by providing the basis for spatial databases with stable category systems and formally rigorous underlying structure. (3) It can provide default characteristics for geographic information systems (GIS) in ways that may contribute to their broader usability by non-experts.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goals of this project are four-fold: (1) to investigate ways to support distributed searching agents for the Web; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of ontology-based Web browsing agents; (3) to study the use of of visualization agents for the Web; and (4) to keep a record of changes to the ontology to study how information changes on the Web. This approach has the following advantages: First, distributing the search process makes more equitable use of computing and network resources and allows search agents to be customized to reflect local interests and preferences. Second, an ontology-based browsing agent allows for more serendipitous access to Web resources. Unlike the current browsing structures (e.g., Yahoo), these browsing agents associate appropriate resources with each concept automatically. The ontology may adapt over time at individual sites, allowing the browsing structure to evolve as the Web itself evolves. Third, the ability to visualize large portions of the Web in a more abstract way allows users to quickly get an impression of what type of information is available. Fourth, by keeping a history of changes to the local ontologies, the ebb and flow of the importance of concepts locally and globally can be presented. Finally, undergraduate and graduate students are being exposed to a truly interdisciplinary research through their involvement in a long term project that combines expertise from several fields, primarily computer graphics, artificial intelligence, distributed processing and information science. The World Wide Web (WWW) offers the promise of unlimited access to electronic information. However currently, the reality is electronic access to unlimited anarchy. This project is addressing the use of conceptual ontologies to bring order to the chaos.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Target-Based Document-Independent Information Extraction&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; With ever-growing volumes of data in widely varying formats, there is a need to sift and funnel information to users to meet their own specific requirements. This project addresses the challenge of finding, extracting, and delivering appropriate data by developing a versatile framework that is target-based (i.e., based on a user&amp;apos;s description of the desired information) and document-independent (i.e., robust, not failing whenever documents change or when new documents of interest are encountered). A combination of document-related clues regarding textual content as well as geometrical and organizational layout enables processing across various document formats. Developers and users specify areas of interest via descriptive ontologies (i.e., declarations of information types and concept relationships). These ontologies facilitate reformulating, matching, and merging retrieved information. The result of these efforts will be a comprehensive infrastructure to extract expertly, organize automatically, and summarize succinctly critical information in a queriable personalized view. An online repository will contain research results, downloadable software (including source code), and a Web interface enabling user access to the various tools and engines developed. Potentially, this technology can be embedded in personal agents; leveraged in customized search, filtering, and extraction tools; and used to provide tailored views of data via integration, organization, and summarization. http://www.deg.byu.edu</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a novel question-answering technology. The features of this technology are as follows: (1) Automatic filtering of questions. During Phase I, Language Computer Corporation (LCC) developed a system that decomposes high-level questions into low-level, fact-seeking questions. Some of these questions, however, turn out to be nonsensical. In Phase II, the firm proposes to submit all of the decomposed questions to a knowledge-based system, which will eliminate questions that are inconsistent with tacit knowledge. All of the questions that survive filtering will be passed back for processing by the question-answering system. (2) Aligning domain ontologies with a large reference ontology. During Phase I, LCC developed a tool that generates domain ontologies from raw text. During Phase II, the firm will extend this tool so that the domain ontologies are automatically aligned with an overarching domain-independent ontology. This alignment will permit deeper expansion of query concepts, because it will allow domain-independent concepts to be augmented with domain-dependent content. (3) Formal evaluation of semantic relations. The foundation of the question-answering system is semantic relations extracted from queries and documents. These relations will be evaluated to assess the relative contribution of each one to question answering. The result of this evaluation will establish which aspects of semantics are most useful to question- answering.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will have a direct impact in the following areas: (1) The system can be deployed in commercial and government settings where the accuracy, coverage, reliability, and usability of the retrieved information are crucial. Ideal applications for the technology include homeland defense, CRM, education, medicine, and the law. (2) The system bridges the gap between domain-independent and domain-specific content. Domain ontologies are constructed automatically, and these ontologies are automatically aligned with a large reference ontology, so that queries can be simultaneously expanded into the terms appropriate to many different domains.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This collaborative project &amp;quot;TANGO&amp;quot; is leveraging strengths of research teams at Brigham Young University (IIS-0414644, PI: David Embley) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (IIS 0414854, PI: George Nagy). TANGO is a framework for organizing domain-specific factual data appearing in independently generated web pages. Algorithms and software are developed for extracting and interpreting individual lists and tables and integrating them with the contents of other tables that present partially overlapping information. The input pages may be HTML, PDF, PostScript, or scanned document image files. The output of the system is an ontology that provides the conceptual framework for the domain. The ontology evolves as web pages with additional relevant data are harvested and processed. Constructing ontologies is currently a labor and skill intensive process. The TANGO framework automates much of the ontology construction task for a domain when information exists in lists and tables that describe the domain. The results of this project build stepping stones to the Semantic Web, for which ontologies are a central component. Therefore, this project will have an impact on users of the Semantic Web, who assisted by the automated software agents developed in this project, can accomplish information-based tasks for research, scholarship, planning, design, education, and entertainment. This cross-disciplinary and cross-university endeavor introduces graduate and undergraduate students to cutting-edge research. Developed tools (including source programs), a corpus of tables both in raw and normalized forms, collected test data, and technical reports can be found at the project website (http://www.tango.byu.edu).</Abstract>

<Abstract>0412904&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Piasecki&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This proposal will advance integrative hydrologic science through the development of a hydrologic information system that can be implemented at universities throughout the United States. It involves collaboration between hydrologic scientists from the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc (CUAHSI) and computer scientists from the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and supports a larger strategy at NSF to develop cyberinfrastructure to advance interdisciplinary study of environmental systems. The CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System will be built around a hydrologic data model that synthesizes data from diverse sources describing the water environment, and will support knowledge discovery through its own analysis and visualization tools and links to external modeling and software systems. The Hydrologic Information System will be built as a network so that data sources from many geographic locations can be automatically harvested and imbedded within a common data framework at the user&amp;apos;s location. In this project, a prototype system will be developed with the San Diego Supercomputer Center as the hub, and the experience thus gained used to define a request for proposals for a CUAHSI Center for Hydrologic Information which will be responsible for the long-term maintenance and support of this system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Integrative hydrologic science will be addressed through a series of CUAHSI science driver questions posed first for a hydrologic observatory planning study of the Neuse River Basin, whose data will be synthesized into the CUAHSI hydrologic data model as a prototype Digital Watershed. Similar Digital Watersheds will be constructed using later CUAHSI planning studies for hydrologic observatories elsewhere in the nation, thus providing a comprehensive information base for comparative studies across different hydrologic regimes. These datasets will be made freely available through an internet interface, and the hydrologic data model will also be provided to hydrologic scientists who want to develop Digital Watersheds at other locations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it harnesses information technology to support hydrologic science by building around a data model that has a coherent intellectual structure and synthesizes data from many disciplines. It will enable the tracing of water movement and transport of constituents vertically between atmosphere, surface water and groundwater, and horizontally through the landscape from watersheds and aquifers to streams, rivers, estuaries and bays. It will integrate data across scales of space and time. This will enable the testing of hypotheses about the interfaces between hydrologic processes in a manner and scale that is rarely attempted now. The results of these studies will be published in journal articles and as a series of CUAHSI monographs. The prototype hydrologic information system developed in this project will be of significant value in itself for hydrologic science research and also as a guide to the future long-term implementation of CUAHSI hydrologic information systems. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impacts of this project include its networking of hydrologic scientists at many universities who will jointly be contributing and receiving hydrologic information. The CUAHSI hydrologic information system and its accompanying datasets will be developed in the public domain and available to the professional hydrology community and to educators at all levels. As educational exercises using this information are developed by CUAHSI scientists, they will be shared with the broader community through such facilities as the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE).</Abstract>

<Abstract>This collaborative project &amp;quot;TANGO&amp;quot; is leveraging strengths of research teams at Brigham Young University (IIS-0414644, PI: David Embley) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (IIS 0414854, PI: George Nagy). TANGO is a framework for organizing domain-specific factual data appearing in independently generated web pages. Algorithms and software are developed for extracting and interpreting individual lists and tables and integrating them with the contents of other tables that present partially overlapping information. The input pages may be HTML, PDF, PostScript, or scanned document image files. The output of the system is an ontology that provides the conceptual framework for the domain. The ontology evolves as web pages with additional relevant data are harvested and processed. Constructing ontologies is currently a labor and skill intensive process. The TANGO framework automates much of the ontology construction task for a domain when information exists in lists and tables that describe the domain. The results of this project build stepping stones to the Semantic Web, for which ontologies are a central component. Therefore, this project will have an impact on users of the Semantic Web, who assisted by the automated software agents developed in this project, can accomplish information-based tasks for research, scholarship, planning, design, education, and entertainment. This cross-disciplinary and cross-university endeavor introduces graduate and undergraduate students to cutting-edge research. Developed tools (including source programs), a corpus of tables both in raw and normalized forms, collected test data, and technical reports can be found at the project website (http://www.tango.byu.edu).</Abstract>

The ontology developed will include such representations as shorelines, hazards, aids to navigation, tide tables, sea lanes, etc. and a related markup language. This will be of benefit as these agencies begin to deploy web-based Q&amp;amp;A systems and automated mission planning, intelligent navigation aids, and route planning tools. The research challenges in this work revolve around representing a domain that is highly dynamic, time-critical and rich in factors and entities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will develop and demonstrate a prototype information retrieval application that creates a customized view of a domain ontology to assist users in retrieving relevant documents from a collection of information. The ontology will be employed to guide users to optimize their query formation; the system will capture and analyze the user&amp;apos;s query development process and term preferences in order to identify term usage patterns. The system will also analyze the choices the user makes to view documents from the search results. The results of the user query analysis and document selection analysis will be used to create a user-specific unique view of the ontology for future searches. This capability will dramatically improve the accuracy, speed, and &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; of context-aware information retrieval systems. It will also enable refinement of the ontology for greater semantic depth and utility. This development will have broad impacts for the information management community. By increasing the depth of semantic understanding through interaction with users, the system will &amp;quot;mine&amp;quot; the expertise of its users to enrich the source ontologies, increasing their usefulness for a broader base of users. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The customizable ontology capability developed under this project will find uses in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, defense/counterterrorism, and manufacturing at a minimum - in every sector reliant on &amp;quot;deep knowledge.&amp;quot; Customizable ontologies will reduce the volume and diversity of information presented to users, improving retrieval accuracy and speed by orders of magnitude and enabling future search engines to deliver - with a single &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; - exactly the information sought. By enabling clearer articulation of user needs based on term usage and preferences, this project is expected to improve information retrieval system efficiency tenfold. The customizable ontology will provide a pathway to dynamic, real-time knowledge management. As just one example, ontology-based advisors offer tremendous opportunities for innovation in product and process development, by enabling designers to draw effectively on the captured knowledge of the enterprise.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This medium ITR project will develop a framework to facilitate science&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;research and education on the semantic web, and will implement and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;evaluate prototype tools and applications for use in the biocomplexity&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and biodiversity domains. These capabilities include the ability to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;collaborate and convey meaning through the automatic and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;semi-automatic semantic annotation of web documents; to improve&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information retrieval using background knowledge and inference; and to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;extract and fuse information from multiple, heterogeneous sources in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;response to a query. A testbed for prototyping these capabilities will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;be the web portal of the National Biological Information&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Infrastructure (http://www.nbii.org/). The framework will include&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;specifications for ontologies, protocols, agents, and tools for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;authoring, automated ingest, and annotation. These tools will leverage&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;collaboratively constructed ontologies to bring diverse communities&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;together and enable community construction of scientific&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;knowledge. Additional domain-independent, general purpose ontologies&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;will be developed to enable metadata about the contents and structure&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of databases and other knowledge repositories to be expressed in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;emerging knowledge markup languages such as RDF and OWL. This will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;enable agents to both access and index the hidden web, and will also&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;support the data mining of diverse and distributed databases.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Semantic Web is based on describing the meaning ? or&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;semantics ? of data on the Web by means of metadata ? data describing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;other data ? in the form of ontologies. The World Wide Web Consortium&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(W3C) has made several recommended standards for ontology languages&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;which differ in expressivity and ease of use. Central to these&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;languages is that they come with a formal semantics, expressed in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;model-theoretic terms, which enables access to implicit knowledge by&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;automated reasoning.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Progress in the adoption of reasoning for ontology languages in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;practice is currently being made, but several obstacles remain to be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;overcome for wide adoption on the Web. Two of the central technical&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;issues are scalability of reasoning algorithms, and dealing with&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;inconsistency of the ontological knowledge bases. These two issues&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;are being addressed in this project.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The scalability issue has its origin in the fact that the expression&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of complex knowledge requires sophisticated ontology languages, like&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the Web Ontology Language OWL, which are inherently difficult to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;reason with ? as witnessed by high computational complexities, usually&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ExpTime or beyond. This project builds on recent new developments in &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;polynomial time languages around OWL in order to remedy this. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In particular, in this project efficient algorithmizations and tools are &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;developed for the largest currently known polynomial-time ontology language, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;called ELP. Reasoning with knowledge bases with expressivity beyond ELP is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;enabled through approximating these knowledge bases within ELP.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The inconsistency issue has its origin in the fact that large knowledge&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;bases, in particular on the web, are usually not centrally engineered,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;but arise out of the merging of different knowledge bases with&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;different underlying perspectives and rationales. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In this project tools are developed for efficient, i.e., &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;polynomial-time reasoning with inconsistent ontologies.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The concrete outcome of the project is an open source reasoning&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;system which is able to reason efficiently with (possibly)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;inconsistent knowledge bases around OWL, in at least an approximate&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;manner. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information see the project web page at &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/projects/tron.html</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award was made to transform the current prototype of the Feeding Experiments End-user Database (FEED) into a data-rich, publicly-available source of physiological data on feeding in mammals that incorporates a novel ontology module. An important innovation is the development of five non-overlapping ontologies related to feeding behavior, function, and structure that will provide the constrained definitions of terms necessary to permit computational comparisons in analyses of phenotypic diversity. Ontology construction begins with an ontology workshop. Ontology and database development will be driven by a set of six use cases that comprise synthetic, phylogenetically-informed analyses aimed at understanding the integrated roles of physiology and morphology during a variety of feeding behaviors in mammals. The research will to initiate new collaborations involving FEED as a primary data source by engaging three scientific communities (reptile feeding physiologists, bioengineers, and developmental biologists) in a series of interdisciplinary use case development workshops. During the workshops, the project team will design and commence work on new use cases that will guide efforts to extend the infrastructure of FEED and permit synthetic studies that cut across traditional knowledge domains. This project is innovative because it generates a proof-of-concept database to facilitate understanding of the complexity and connectivity between behaviors, physiological mechanisms, and structures involved in mammalian feeding across multiple scales of organization, and because it includes work to insure that FEED is a tool that is extensible to other scientific communities.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts include development and public release of novel bioinformatic research infrastructure for physiology, a field that has traditionally been on the periphery of bioinformatics. This project promotes interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists across four knowledge domains. Training of undergraduate and graduate students in research on morphological and physiological analysis as well as database and ontology construction is an important focus. FEED will also be utilized as a teaching tool in bioinformatics courses aimed at undergraduate and graduate education in informatics. Dissemination of project outcomes and public access to the FEED database will be available at www.feedexp.org.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This grant provides funding to investigate an information management infrastructure to support the planning and development of families of engineered products and systems for mass customization. The research will be conducted by a multi-university team comprised of faculty from the Pennsylvania State University, Bucknell University, the University of Missouri-Rolla, and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. The research will address three information technology challenges that include an information management infrastructure, a graphical modeling environment, and an agent-based synthesis framework to support product family planning and customization. First, a generalized information management infrastructure will be developed to facilitate capturing information regarding component sharing and reuse within a family of products. Next, a graphical modeling environment will be created to facilitate product family planning and construction, requirements specification, and customer preference capture. Finally, an agent-based synthesis framework will be developed to help configure platform concepts and customized variants within a product family. The research will be conducted in collaboration with industrial and government partners that include Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney, General Motors, Apprentice Systems, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results of this research will expand the utilization of information technology across engineering by developing a novel approach for managing design information related to product family planning for mass customization. The work will extend current representation and interoperability standards for product design repositories. The theoretical foundations developed for product family planning and information management will provide the basic framework for the development of an experimental prototype graphical modeling environment to test the validity of the proposed representation and agent-based synthesis methods. This modeling environment will also contribute to the development of integrated and interactive solution procedures for product family planning and synthesis. The project also has an educational component to it. The grant will foster undergraduate and graduate student exchanges between the four universities that are involved in this research, and projects based on the proposed research will be integrated within six undergraduate and six graduate courses at the four universities. Technology transfer will also occur with the industrial partners involved in the research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project supports the operations of the Plant Ontology Consortium (POC). The goals of the POC are to develop a common set of controlled vocabulary terms to describe anatomic and developmental stage terms in both experimental and agronomically important plants. We have begun with Arabidopsis and cereals, and will later extend this ontology to encompass legumes, Solanaceae, and other families. Concurrently, we are applying these terms to the task of describing the genes and mutants that are contained within the plant-specific databases maintained by the participating institutions, thereby simultaneously refining the ontologies, and providing points of reference with which to compare the genes and mutants across these species.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact of this project is that it provides a framework of plant development to allow researchers to make meaningful cross-database queries across the various species-specific resources in order to discover patterns of similarities and dissimilarities involved in plant development. For example, researchers will be able to obtain a definitive list of genes whose action affects plant stem development. The interaction between research communities will be facilitated by a &amp;quot;Rosetta stone&amp;quot; that bridges their historical differences in terminology. This will allow the fruits of research in one plant species to be more easily used in the study of other species, leading to a greater understanding of plant biology. This in turn will aid in the creation of new varieties of crop plants to meet the food needs of an ever-growing world population, to the development of pharmaceuticals to treat human disease, and the creation of new classes of herbicides, pesticides and biological control measure to counter the growing impact of resistant weeds and pests on world-wide agriculture.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Deliverables&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Deliverables from this project include: (a) an ontology describing plant anatomy; (b) an ontology describing plant developmental stages; (c) a web site that stores plant ontology associations to strains, mutants and genes from multiple participant databases; (d) a series of users group meetings that provide education and outreach opportunities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award was made to transform the current prototype of the Feeding Experiments End-user Database (FEED) into a data-rich, publicly-available source of physiological data on feeding in mammals that incorporates a novel ontology module. An important innovation is the development of five non-overlapping ontologies related to feeding behavior, function, and structure that will provide the constrained definitions of terms necessary to permit computational comparisons in analyses of phenotypic diversity. Ontology construction begins with an ontology workshop. Ontology and database development will be driven by a set of six use cases that comprise synthetic, phylogenetically-informed analyses aimed at understanding the integrated roles of physiology and morphology during a variety of feeding behaviors in mammals. The research will to initiate new collaborations involving FEED as a primary data source by engaging three scientific communities (reptile feeding physiologists, bioengineers, and developmental biologists) in a series of interdisciplinary use case development workshops. During the workshops, the project team will design and commence work on new use cases that will guide efforts to extend the infrastructure of FEED and permit synthetic studies that cut across traditional knowledge domains. This project is innovative because it generates a proof-of-concept database to facilitate understanding of the complexity and connectivity between behaviors, physiological mechanisms, and structures involved in mammalian feeding across multiple scales of organization, and because it includes work to insure that FEED is a tool that is extensible to other scientific communities.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts include development and public release of novel bioinformatic research infrastructure for physiology, a field that has traditionally been on the periphery of bioinformatics. This project promotes interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists across four knowledge domains. Training of undergraduate and graduate students in research on morphological and physiological analysis as well as database and ontology construction is an important focus. FEED will also be utilized as a teaching tool in bioinformatics courses aimed at undergraduate and graduate education in informatics. Dissemination of project outcomes and public access to the FEED database will be available at www.feedexp.org.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This grant provides funding to investigate an information management infrastructure to support the planning and development of families of engineered products and systems for mass customization. The research will be conducted by a multi-university team comprised of faculty from the Pennsylvania State University, Bucknell University, the University of Missouri-Rolla, and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. The research will address three information technology challenges that include an information management infrastructure, a graphical modeling environment, and an agent-based synthesis framework to support product family planning and customization. First, a generalized information management infrastructure will be developed to facilitate capturing information regarding component sharing and reuse within a family of products. Next, a graphical modeling environment will be created to facilitate product family planning and construction, requirements specification, and customer preference capture. Finally, an agent-based synthesis framework will be developed to help configure platform concepts and customized variants within a product family. The research will be conducted in collaboration with industrial and government partners that include Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney, General Motors, Apprentice Systems, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results of this research will expand the utilization of information technology across engineering by developing a novel approach for managing design information related to product family planning for mass customization. The work will extend current representation and interoperability standards for product design repositories. The theoretical foundations developed for product family planning and information management will provide the basic framework for the development of an experimental prototype graphical modeling environment to test the validity of the proposed representation and agent-based synthesis methods. This modeling environment will also contribute to the development of integrated and interactive solution procedures for product family planning and synthesis. The project also has an educational component to it. The grant will foster undergraduate and graduate student exchanges between the four universities that are involved in this research, and projects based on the proposed research will be integrated within six undergraduate and six graduate courses at the four universities. Technology transfer will also occur with the industrial partners involved in the research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Emerging semantic technologies are enabling us to focus on environmental and health concepts and their interrelationships in new ways. This project will develop an extended metadata registry prototype, populate it with environmental, health and geographical metadata, develop semantic services for querying and test the usability and performance. The registry will support the integration of taxonomies, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, semantic relations and advance data element specifi9cation, all I the context of water information. This multi-disciplinary project will work through a coalition of research efforts coordinated internationally. The work should lead to advances in both standards and technologies that address the limitations in semantic technologies that need to evolve with laws and regulations as well as semantic usage. The effort will provide technical leadership in coordinating several ecoinformatics projects, helping researchers to collaborate. The techniques, technologies and designs developed by this project will hae immediate application within the environment and healthcare communities. The area also has potential for impact on data sharing. Results will be disseminated through open source software for the registry and through the ISO/IEC Standard 11179.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of Massachusetts-Amherst is renewing its participation in the e-Design center, an I/UCRC center that was created in 2003. The lead institution is Virginia Tech, and the center at present includes three universities and approximately seventeen industry members. The mission and Vision of the NSF Center for e-Design is to serve as a national center of excellence in IT-enabled design and realization of manufactured products. E-Design involves conceptualizing, designing and realizing a product (or system) using methods and software tools that allow for interoperability of remote and heterogeneous systems and support collaboration among distributed, multidisciplinary stakeholders. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The University of Massachusetts (UMass) will bring expertise in three of the four Center thrust areas, including: New Design Paradigms and Processes, Design Optimization, and Enabling Information Infrastructure. Researchers at UMass will be focused on the development and application of engineering ontologies related to product design to enable seamless collaboration and interoperability of engineering tools and people in a distributed web-environment. The joint research efforts of researchers at the other Center institutions (Virginia Tech and University of Central Florida) both complement and strengthen the work at UMass. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed Center renewal will enable UMass to continue its key research and leadership role in the Center, as well as contribute significantly to the successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students. Benefits to students will include integration of resulting work into coursework and engineering curricula, as well as internship opportunities. The center will provide a unique experience to students who can interact and collaborate with industrial researchers and engineers. Research and educational findings will continue to be disseminated nationally and will have a significant impact on US industry as a whole.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of Nebraska is awarded a grant to develop the Semantic Cyberinfrastructure for Investigation and Discovery (SCID), a general-purpose Web-based ontological software infrastructure that (1) unites numerous biological research interests by enabling seamless federation of heterogeneous databases from each area; (2) supports scientists in the efficient and effective use of ontologies to enhance investigation and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;discovery; and (3) streamlines the use of bioinformatics tools via common user interfaces for querying data, enhanced data analyses, and interpretation of scientific results, thus enabling discovery by those who enter or cross over into new research fields. Leveraging its long-standing collaboration between faculty from genomics, museum science, and computer science, the SCID team will enhance its existing prototype by (1) developing a &amp;quot;seed&amp;quot; ontology that unites multiple selected databases in biodiversity and genomics, (2) providing an application programming interface (API) to allow new and existing bioinformatics tools to easily &amp;quot;plug in&amp;quot; to our system, (3) developing tools to facilitate the process of reaching scientific consensus in open forums through collaborative editing technologies, and (4) developing tools to support ontological development, federation of disparate data stores, and decision making during investigation and discovery activities. This project will advance genomics and biodiversity research by federating and unifying data sources in biodiversity and genomics, unlocking heterogeneous, largescale databases, and empowering investigation and discovery. It will also advance the computational areas of machine learning, multiagent systems, and semantic technologies for extracting information from large data repositories, supporting users in making investigations and discoveries, and facilitating community-based knowledge engineering.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;New computational models that are developed as part of SCID will facilitate the building of ontologies that tie together disparate databases, support automatic inferences and deductions, allow for data consistency checks, and allow posing of sophisticated queries, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;thus creating an innovative, dynamic scientific structure.</Abstract>

By utilizing a cooperative, as opposed to competitive, process like that which created the Internet and Open Source software, EarthCube will attack the recalcitrant and persistent problems that so far have prevented adequate access to and the analysis, visualization, and interoperability of the vast storehouses of disparate geoscience data and data types residing in distributed and diverse data systems. This award funds a series of broad community interactions to gather adequate information and requirements to create a roadmap for a critical cyberinfrastructure capability (semantics and ontologies) in the development of EarthCube. In the context of cyberinfrastructure, semantics and ontologies are what allows heterogeneous and distributed data systems to become interoperable. They enable scientists to register, discover, access, and integrate data irrespective of its structural heterogeneity. This work convenes public, online/virtual meetings and seeks broad community input in the development of a process to have the geoscience and cyberinfrastructure communities converge on a way forward in the realm of semantics and ontologies for data, with the end product being a capability implementation roadmap. Also involved in the process is the identification of appropriate community agreed upon use cases. Broader impacts of the work include development of approaches, protocols, and standards that may be applicable across the sciences and the fostering of close interaction between communities that do not commonly interact, to a great extent, with one another moving them toward a common goal of the creation of a new paradigm in data and knowledge management in the geosciences.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Spatial and temporal data are critical components in many applications. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This is especially true in analytical applications ranging from scientific &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;discovery to national security and criminal investigation. This exploratory &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;research develops of new methods for modeling and querying spatial, temporal &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and thematic (STT) data. The methods differ significantly from traditional&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;approaches for STT data management; they follow a paradigm that goes beyond &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;querying for resources to querying about the relationships between resources.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Three STT data management advances this will lead to are: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) new query operators that exploit the graph-centric nature &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of Semantic Web data models, (2) new indexing and query processing &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques for STT data that are specialized for Semantic Web data models &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and (3) an extension of the SPARQL RDF query language to support STT queries.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A second aspect of this project is to compare the STT-RDF &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;approach described above with an alternative approach based on OWL-DL &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. This exploratory &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;study evaluates whether the STT-RDF analytics approach provides a &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;more efficient and expressive query language than the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;OWL-DL approach with space-time ontology. Specifically, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) for the queries that can be encoded in both the formalisms, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is the former implementation more efficient? and (2) are there &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;queries that can be formulated in the STT-RDF analytics formalism&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that cannot be expressed as OWL-DL queries? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Throughout this project, special attention is given to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;repeatability of experimental results. All code will be open source, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and all benchmarks, datasets and ontologies will be available &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;through the project web site at&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://knoesis.wright.edu/research/semweb/projects/stt/</Abstract>

<Abstract>Sawflies, ants, bees, wasps (Hymenoptera) comprise an extraordinarily diverse lineage of insects, with more than 115,000 described species and likely 1,000,000 species yet to be discovered. These insects serve critical roles as pollinators, parasitoids, herbivores, and as models for research on social behavior, physiology, speciation genetics, and to explore parasite-host interactions. The vast anatomical diversity exhibited by these organisms, coupled with a large body of disparate research and the eccentricities of investigators, yields numerous concurrent and only partially overlapping vocabularies that describe Hymenoptera anatomy. Centuries of Hymenoptera research, therefore, remain clouded by inconsistent terminology (for example, &amp;apos;annellus&amp;apos; is used for two different head structures and for a part of the male genitalia).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will bring Hymenoptera researchers together to build a consensus structured vocabulary (the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology) that 1) enables discovery of research results from publications, 2) empowers taxonomists to efficiently describe/ diagnose species and 3) provide improved access to information for policy makers, farmers, land managers and the general public. Tools will be developed that allow collaborators to virtually build ontologies for any group of species, while making these data useful to the research community via a Web-based anatomical atlas and application programming interface; all software will be open source (http://purl.oclc.org/NET/hymontology).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Three postdocs and three students will receive training in an emerging&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;field: ontologies in evolutionary biology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Linked Open Data (LOD) is rapidly developing into an open data movement to connect a large variety of data across the World Wide Web using standards adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Driven by researchers, government agencies and companies, the resulting Web of Data has grown to over 25 billion RDF triples and is showing exponential growth. However, simply putting collections of data on the Web will be of very limited value. The key to unlocking the value for developing more powerful search, browsing, exploration and analysis is to richly interlink or semantically integrate components of LOD. Given the size, growth rate, heterogeneity and growing areas of coverage, manual semantic integration or interlinking is not practical. Furthermore, current techniques focus on &amp;apos;same-as&amp;apos; relationship, which is much abused due to limited expressivity. This calls for ways to represent and identify richer and more explicit relationships between different entities that reflect the richness of relations that exist in the real world.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project develops exploratory techniques to richly interlink components of LOD and then addresses the challenge of querying the LOD cloud, i.e., of obtaining answers to questions which require accessing, retrieving and combining information from different parts of the LOD cloud. Techniques for overcoming semantic heterogeneity include: semantic enrichment through Wikipedia bootstrapping; semantic integration through abstraction by means of upper-level ontologies; and, massively parallel methods for tractable ontology reasoning. Specifically, this research will: (1) identify richer, broader, and more relevant relationships between LOD datasets at instance and schema level (these relationships will promote better knowledge discovery, querying, and mapping of ontologies); (2) realize LOD query federation through an upper level ontology; and, (3) enable access to implicit knowledge through ontology reasoning. The project involves significant risk as it treads new paths in a new terrain, primarily due to the lack of descriptive information (schema) about the data provided by highly autonomous data sources, the significant syntactic and semantic heterogeneity among data originating from independent data sources, and the significantly larger scale, as well as unforeseeable obstacles associated with a rapidly changing and expanding environment. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project aims to advance the state of the art in semantic integration of large amounts of heterogeneous and autonomously developed or managed data. It seeks to fundamentally transform the landscape of LOD usage because successful LOD querying is a key enabler for a variety of applications. The results of this project could set the stage for the development, and the far reaching adoption, of Semantic Web. The project is integrated with education and research-based advanced training of graduate and undergraduate students.

<Abstract>The goal of this engineering education research project is to help students develop more fundamentally accurate mental models of small-scale dynamic processes. Given the current interest in advances in nanotechnology (e.g.microfluidics, biotechnology, genetic engineering, nanoscale machines), new engineering graduates must have a firm grip of fundamental processes, which are characterized by small-scale dynamic systems. Therefore it must be determined whether engineering students can be provided with instruction concerning a particular ontological schema (e.g., the Emergent Process ontology), and whether their acquisition of this schema improves their ability to learn new conceptual content from the relevant ontology. The proposed study will address two research questions: (1) why do educated engineering students persist in incorrectly describing small-scale processes using macroscopic models? and (2) how can we design instructional approaches that lead such students to understand and use more scientifically correct models? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PIs will test Chi and Slotta&amp;apos;s theory of emergent phenomena by creating effective schema training protocols and materials for helping engineering students create appropriate mental models of fundamentally important dynamic processes operating at small length scales. They will build on the successful theoretical framework offered by Chi and her colleagues, as well as on-going research by Miller and Streveler concerning engineering students&amp;apos; misconceptions in thermal and transport sciences. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In order to compare the proposed study to previous and ongoing work by Chi and Slotta, the design of the proposed training is parallel to their carefully controlled research designs. Through this design the PIs will be able to gather evidence that can support or refute Chi&amp;apos;s Emergence theory (thus forwarding the knowledge base in cognitive psychology) as well as explore how Chi&amp;apos;s theory can inform the engineering education community about how students learn engineering (thus forwarding the engineering education research knowledge base). The PIs will also gain knowledge about how to teach engineering students about emergence, and have evidence to support the inclusion of this kind of training in the engineering curriculum.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project supports a workshop to bring together:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; a) computer scientists working on formal semantics methods,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; e.g., ontologies, knowledge representation languages&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; b) accounting and accounting information systems faculty,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; c) developers of standards for financial reporting systems,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; such as XBRL, UN CEFACT, SDMX, ...&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; d) government statisticians working on the generation of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; economic statistics&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; e) staff from government financial and securities&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; regulatory agencies&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to consider research issues and the potential utility &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and impact of formal semantics methods (e.g., ontologies,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;knowledge representation languages, description logic, etc.)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for the specification of financial reporting systems &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and standards for financial information (reporting)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;systems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;----------------------&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Financial reporting systems consist of financial transaction systems&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(e.g., general ledger), classification schemes (notably charts of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;accounts), and aggregation mechanisms (e.g., summing all of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;transactions for particular accounts).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Historic practice in the specification of financial information&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;system standards is to specify the semantics via natural language&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;texts. The PI and others believe that this is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;inadequate to assure reliable semantic interoperability among &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the various accounting standards and systems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This workshop is the first to bring together researchers from&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the formal semantics / KR / ontology communities and the accounting&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;community. It is to explore the prospects for interaction of these&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;two communities and write a report with a research agenda for &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;work in this interdisciplinary area of formal semantic specification&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of financial information systems and the implications for &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interoperatibility of these financial reporting systems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Financial information systems are an essential component in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the management of large organizations - business, government,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and nonprofits. They are an essential component of the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;securities and banking industries, securities and banking regulatory &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;agencies and operation of taxation systems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Financial reporting systems are also the basis from which &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;economic statistics, such as national income statistics and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;trade statistics are generated. Improvements in the semantic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;specification of these financial information systems will &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;facilitate the automation of the financial reporting chain,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and improve the reliability of interoperability and integration&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of such financial reporting systems within businesses, and between&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;businesses and regulatory and taxation agencies.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Finally, the adoption of formal semantic specifications for &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;financial reporting systems will entail substantial changes in the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;training of accounting information system professionals.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Project web page: http://www.msu.edu/user/mccarth4/NSFontology/</Abstract>

<Abstract>&amp;quot;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The University of Arizona is awarded a grant to develop tools that enable biologists to better integrate web data and services. The project has three specific goals. First, it will develop ontologies as the &amp;quot;currency&amp;quot; of semantic web services. Ontologies were historically built as static categorizations of knowledge, yet now need to be re-factored in order to use them effectively for data and service integration. Second, it will advance semantic searching as a method to transform discovery and service engagement in biology. This is achieved by extending semantic searching from explicit ontology subsumption assertions to full implicit subsumption relations. Semantic searching?the most innovative and powerful contribution of this work?unites data and services using ontologies into a searchable knowledge base complete with logical inference. Finally, it will integrate education, outreach, and training as an integral part of development in semantic web services. The project will carry out these activities in collaboration with St. John&amp;apos;s College and the National Center for Genome Resources. Particularly for developers at major information resources, this training component introduces practitioners to the use and implementation of semantic web services. Access to the products of this grant will be available at http://sswap.info. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The approach is to recognize that for much of biology the information medium for data discovery, access, and assimilation is the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web means that data and algorithms?services?are, and will continue to be, distributed, heterogeneous, and often persistent, yet also dynamic and sometimes ephemeral; that integration on top of this informatics landscape means that we need to address fundamental issues in common syntaxes, shared semantics, and on-demand discovery. Semantic web services, and the ability to semantically search for resources and engage them have value beyond biology. In this manner, the work moves the web towards a distributed, logical network amenable to machine reasoning.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many application domains, such as intelligence, counter-terrorism,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;forensics, disease control, often need to cross-match multiple very&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;large datasets, such as watch lists. Because those datasets may &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;contain privacy-sensitive or confidential information, the use of efficient&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;privacy-preserving protocols for cross-matching different datasets is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;crucial. The problem of privacy-preserving record matching has been&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;addressed by the use of Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) protocols.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Under these protocols, the data are converted to series of functions&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;with private inputs. However a major drawback of SMC-based protocols&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is that they involve extensive cryptographic primitives such as&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;homomorphic encryption which do not scale to the size of practical&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;problems. As a result, SMC-based protocols cannot be used for resource&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;constrained data-intensive privacy-preserving record matching approaches &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;directly. This project develops a novel approach based on the observation&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that to apply SMC to practical applications, one needs to bridge the gap &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;between the size of the datasets that can efficiently be matched using &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;SMC protocols and the size of the datasets seen in practice. The approach &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;taken by the project tackles the problem from a novel angle by developing &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques to reduce the size of practical problems by employing &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;privacy-preserving data sanitization methods. The project thus solves &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the privacy-preserving data matching problems through the following&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;steps. First, to protect the privacy of data subjects, useful statistics &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;about data is gathered using differential privacy. Second, differentially &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;private statistics are shared among the parties involved in data matching. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These parties then identify potential matching pairs where fruitful matching &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;may occur. Such a step is referred to as data blocking. Finally, SMC &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques are applied to these candidates to accurately cross-match&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information. In addition to syntactic matching, semantic matching is supported &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;by which records are compared according to some semantic similarity functions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The semantic matching protocols includes techniques for matching and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;aligning ontologies, as the use of ontologies is crucial for an effective&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;semantic matching. This project is the first to use differential privacy for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;efficient privacy-preserving record matching that also leverages semantics-based&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;approach and a privacy-preserving approach to ontology alignment. The techniques&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;developed in the project are the first to achieve efficient privacy-preserving&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;matching of large scale data sets using differential privacy, thus overcoming &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the scalability problems of conventional SMC techniques. The approach developed &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in this project expands the opportunities and contexts for data use by enabling &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the cross-match of multiple data archives, possibly owned by different parties, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;without violating the privacy of the data. Many applications, of interest &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for our society, will benefit by such opportunities.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bertino/prirelink</Abstract>

<Abstract>EarthCube is focused on community-driven development of an integrated, and interoperable knowledge management system for data in the geo- and environmental sciences. By utilizing a cooperative, as opposed to competitive, process like that which created the Internet and Open Source software, EarthCube will attack the recalcitrant and persistent problems that so far have prevented adequate access to and the analysis, visualization, and interoperability of the vast storehouses of disparate geoscience data and data types residing in distributed and diverse data systems. This award funds a series of broad community interactions to gather adequate information and requirements to create a roadmap for a critical cyberinfrastructure capability (semantics and ontologies) in the development of EarthCube. In the context of cyberinfrastructure, semantics and ontologies are what allows heterogeneous and distributed data systems to become interoperable. They enable scientists to register, discover, access, and integrate data irrespective of its structural heterogeneity. This work convenes public, online/virtual meetings and seeks broad community input in the development of a process to have the geoscience and cyberinfrastructure communities converge on a way forward in the realm of semantics and ontologies for data, with the end product being a capability implementation roadmap. Also involved in the process is the identification of appropriate community agreed upon use cases. Broader impacts of the work include development of approaches, protocols, and standards that may be applicable across the sciences and the fostering of close interaction between communities that do not commonly interact, to a great extent, with one another moving them toward a common goal of the creation of a new paradigm in data and knowledge management in the geosciences.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Proposal Number: IIS-0241229&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Principal Investigator: Thomas Moritz&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This international collaborative project proposes to design and test approaches to mark-up and extraction of scientific date from a corpus drawn from the biosystematics literature of entomology (ants) and to develop a set of applications bases on an ontology for this topical area. Ontologies for natural history information are particularly complex because of the diversity of the source material and selected descriptors. The project will build on digital library work underway at the American Museum of Natural History, on biological informatics at Ohio State University and computer science at Universitat Magdeburg in Germany. The project is jointly sponsored by the German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Biosystematics is the science that provides the definitional foundations for organismic biology and for the applied science of biodiversity conservation. Within zoological systematics, insects are a uniquely important group of organisms with major impacts on human health and economics; ants constitute a particularly important group of social insects accounting for a major part of the biomass in tropical rainforests and displaying remarkable diversity and behavioral variation. This proposal is designed to test approaches to mark-up and extraction of scientific data from a corpus of texts drawn from the biosystematics literature of entomology (ants) and to develop a set of applications including powerful search and retrieval strategies to operate on this corpus. Specifically, approaches to automated XML mark-up will be tested using NMNH hypothesized Taxon-X Schema (derived from the implicit structure of scientific publications in biological systematics and already under development at AMNH). Then the corpus of marked-up literature will be used to explore the automated extraction and application of imbedded scientific data including scientific names, morphological characters, species distribution data (for plotting in GIS and contribution to the emerging world database of biological diversity) and collection locales/events for inclusion in a gazetteer of collecting events.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Accomplishment of these goals will result in increased worldwide access and usefulness of an extensive body of scientific literature that is now generally restricted to users who have access to major research libraries. The project will also stimulate interdisciplinary interaction between computer scientists and domain specialists in a field that stands to benefit greatly from IT research. The core work of this project will contribute to global efforts to design and implement of similar, general purpose ontological services capable of supporting biological and conservation education at all levels. These project can contribute to research and education in biology by prototyping a model by extending the practical usefulness of the enormous body of legacy literature in biosystematics and contributing to the completion and continuing updating of international biodiversity databases. The corpus of literature to be made available on the Web -- as well as the methodology and protocols for managing them -- occurring in the context of the Commonsphilosophy can create a new model for international access to this literature offering access to biosystematics libraries to those who have never before had such resources available.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The focus of this project is to develop models and technologies for prevention of security threats via illegal inferences in semantically enhanced semistructured information. XML and RDF data has been increasingly used for storing and exchanging information, thus enabling Internet users to access and integrate large amounts of data intelligently. This large-scale data integration, especially when supported with ontologies, may pose significant security and privacy threats. Therefore, security methods and tools need to be developed to prevent security violations. To provide information assurance in the context of Semantic Web several issues - technological, managerial, and legal - need to be addressed. This project focuses mainly on technological issues to provide information confidentiality and privacy, and makes several novel contributions: (1) Web data that can express context-based and semantic requirements; (2) comprehensive study of the security implications for illegal inference capabilities on semistructured data; and (3) both defensive and offensive security models are considered in Semantic Web security. More information about the project is available on the project web site (http://www.cse.sc.edu/research/isl). In addition to theoretical research, the developed models and technologies will be implemented and tested on real data. The prototypes will be evaluated based on scalability, efficiency, and level of assurance. Broader impact of this project lies in providing data security on the Web and a wide range of Web applications, with a guarantee of information confidentiality. Research and educational activities are tied together to increase the security awareness of students and community. In addition, seminars and Web sites to increase cyber-security awareness of middle and high school students will be developed, aiming to reduce the number of cyber crimes exploiting juvenile users.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Sawflies, ants, bees, wasps (Hymenoptera) comprise an extraordinarily diverse lineage of insects, with more than 115,000 described species and likely 1,000,000 species yet to be discovered. These insects serve critical roles as pollinators, parasitoids, herbivores, and as models for research on social behavior, physiology, speciation genetics, and to explore parasite-host interactions. The vast anatomical diversity exhibited by these organisms, coupled with a large body of disparate research and the eccentricities of investigators, yields numerous concurrent and only partially overlapping vocabularies that describe Hymenoptera anatomy. Centuries of Hymenoptera research, therefore, remain clouded by inconsistent terminology (for example, &amp;apos;annellus&amp;apos; is used for two different head structures and for a part of the male genitalia).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will bring Hymenoptera researchers together to build a consensus structured vocabulary (the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology) that 1) enables discovery of research results from publications, 2) empowers taxonomists to efficiently describe/ diagnose species and 3) provide improved access to information for policy makers, farmers, land managers and the general public. Tools will be developed that allow collaborators to virtually build ontologies for any group of species, while making these data useful to the research community via a Web-based anatomical atlas and application programming interface; all software will be open source (http://purl.oclc.org/NET/hymontology).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Three postdocs and three students will receive training in an emerging&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;field: ontologies in evolutionary biology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many application domains, such as intelligence, counter-terrorism,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;forensics, disease control, often need to cross-match multiple very&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;large datasets, such as watch lists. Because those datasets may &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;contain privacy-sensitive or confidential information, the use of efficient&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;privacy-preserving protocols for cross-matching different datasets is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;crucial. The problem of privacy-preserving record matching has been&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;addressed by the use of Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) protocols.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Under these protocols, the data are converted to series of functions&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;with private inputs. However a major drawback of SMC-based protocols&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is that they involve extensive cryptographic primitives such as&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;homomorphic encryption which do not scale to the size of practical&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;problems. As a result, SMC-based protocols cannot be used for resource&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;constrained data-intensive privacy-preserving record matching approaches &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;directly. This project develops a novel approach based on the observation&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that to apply SMC to practical applications, one needs to bridge the gap &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;between the size of the datasets that can efficiently be matched using &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;SMC protocols and the size of the datasets seen in practice. The approach &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;taken by the project tackles the problem from a novel angle by developing &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques to reduce the size of practical problems by employing &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;privacy-preserving data sanitization methods. The project thus solves &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the privacy-preserving data matching problems through the following&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;steps. First, to protect the privacy of data subjects, useful statistics &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;about data is gathered using differential privacy. Second, differentially &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;private statistics are shared among the parties involved in data matching. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These parties then identify potential matching pairs where fruitful matching &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;may occur. Such a step is referred to as data blocking. Finally, SMC &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques are applied to these candidates to accurately cross-match&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information. In addition to syntactic matching, semantic matching is supported &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;by which records are compared according to some semantic similarity functions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The semantic matching protocols includes techniques for matching and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;aligning ontologies, as the use of ontologies is crucial for an effective&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;semantic matching. This project is the first to use differential privacy for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;efficient privacy-preserving record matching that also leverages semantics-based&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;approach and a privacy-preserving approach to ontology alignment. The techniques&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;developed in the project are the first to achieve efficient privacy-preserving&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;matching of large scale data sets using differential privacy, thus overcoming &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the scalability problems of conventional SMC techniques. The approach developed &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in this project expands the opportunities and contexts for data use by enabling &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the cross-match of multiple data archives, possibly owned by different parties, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;without violating the privacy of the data. Many applications, of interest &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for our society, will benefit by such opportunities.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bertino/prirelink</Abstract>

<Abstract>Knowledge of how an organism looks, behaves and functions, i.e., its &amp;quot;phenotype&amp;quot;, is central to interpreting the interaction of underlying genes and environmental effects. Representing phenotype in a way that can be linked to thousands of molecular genetic and environmental databases, however, remains difficult. The goal of this project is to establish a network of experts on plant and animal phenotypes and on computer representation methods (ontologies) from communities that are independently developing ways to represent and share phenotypic data. Through this Research Coordination Network, scientists will be brought together and their activities coordinated to: (1) develop standards and best practices for accurate phenotype representations; (2) build key reference ontologies for plants, vertebrates, and arthropods; and (3) cross reference these ontologies so that key data can be easily shared and accessed. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Coordinating scientific efforts so that effective linkages are built into databases from the outset is an efficient and economical mechanism to develop a data network. Plants and animals show complex integration across genes, phenotype and environment, and a network of these data will enable rapid scientific discovery and progress. This project also will reach out to scientists who can use the data, help them link to it, and educate their communities about these computational methods and their utility.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The objective of this work is to extend significantly the capabilities of portals created by the geospatial community, by providing semantic integration over diverse data sets. For example, the Wisconsin Land Information System and the new Federal Geospatial One-Stop portals disseminate data and support procedures and simulations in emergency situations. However, geospatial data are complex and highly heterogeneous, having been developed independently by various levels of government and the private sector. This project includes metadata integration methods to enable more precise location of data sources over the web and to provide geospatial portals with query capabilities and semantic resolution for the types of information integration that could help in information discovery, problem-solving, or emergency response.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research will develop methods and tools to support the integration of information in such a way that end users will have a homogeneous view over heterogeneous data sources. An ontology-based architecture will be developed with which each individual heterogeneous data source can be added to the network of information with relatively little effort. Ontology mappings will establish correspondences between terms in heterogeneous sources and those of standard models and ontologies. The approach also extends ontology mappings to incorporate semantics regarding spatial considerations, such as accuracy, for spatial integration.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Information integration is an area of research that stretches over databases, artificial intelligence, digital libraries, and the semantic web. This project will extend significantly the state of the art of information integration in general and of geospatial information integration in particular, by providing a robust and scalable framework that encompasses techniques and algorithms for integrating heterogeneous data sources using an ontology-based approach.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project&amp;apos;s goal of semantic integration for geospatial data fits into a broad vision for creating a cyberinfrastructure on the Web. In a geospatial cyberinfrastructure, data will be automatically located and semantically matched to other relevant data sources. Manual intervention will not be needed or will be minimal. With such a structure, emergency managers, government officials, and the general public will not be constrained to pre-formulated queries. Instead, ad hoc, exploratory queries and analyses will be possible. From an educational viewpoint, the project will significantly benefit the training of graduate and undergraduate students, in particular of women and minorities, and will include the design of new graduate and undergraduate courses.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Search technology today is dominated by search engines such as the one provided by Google where for a given query string s , a set D of documents is retrieved with the aid of an algorithm that ranks the elements of D on the basis of how many other documents link to it. This research will investigate the issues involved in the development of a search engine that supports geographic location retrieval, and its deployment in a setting involving digital government applications where it is also desirable to retrieve documents on the basis of spatial proximity. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit: (1) Identifying geographic references in documents is a challenging issue and is necessary for advanced search applications. This is especially true in the case of users who want to browse large collections of documents that are not necessarily on the web and to explore and discover spatial relationships either in the same document or in a collection of documents. (2) Increasingly, users are looking for documents that contain spatially proximate content. Thus the traditional method of ranking by the link structure of the web is not appropriate. Determining the geographic focus of a document is a difficult task but is necessary in applications such as those dealing with documents on the hidden web, which is a set of documents, usually proprietary, that is for internal use of an organization and is often not available on the Internet. This means that there are few, if any links to these documents, and thus popular internet search strategies are not applicable. (3) Treating spatial content of documents as a first-class citizen, in the sense that a geographic scope is reported for each document that is retrieved regardless of whether the query has a spatial component, is difficult given the need to resolve issues related to aliasing (realizing that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Los Angeles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;LA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are the same) and ambiguity (different interpretations for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;London&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). (4) Developing query optimization and execution strategies for queries that involve both a textual and spatial component. (5) Developing effective techniques for measuring spatial similarity other than proximity, as well as techniques for measuring combinations of spatial and textual similarity. This includes the adaptation of the skyline operator. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broad Impacts: The ability to retrieve documents on the basis of spatial proximity makes for a better search experience and will lead to more relevant results. The tools to be developed will also extend the reach of search engines from being restricted to documents on the internet to documents that reside on the hidden web. The deployment of these tools in government web sites via collaboration with the grant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s digital government partners has the effect of empowering citizens to find out what their government is doing, thereby leading to a more informed citizenry.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Advances in networks, sensors, storage, computing, and high throughput data acquisition, have led to a proliferation of autonomous, distributed data sources in many areas of human activity. New discoveries in biological, physical, and social sciences and engineering are being driven by our ability to discover, share, integrate and analyze disparate types of data. Statistically-based machine learning algorithms offer some of the most cost-effective approaches to discovery of experimentally testable predictive models and hypotheses from data. However, the large size, distributed nature, and autonomy of the data sources (and the attendant differences in access, queries allowed, processing capabilities, structure, organization, and underlying data models and data semantics) present hurdles to effective utilization of machine learning. This research aims to overcome these hurdles by developing efficient, resource-aware distributed algorithms and software services to support collaborative, integrative knowledge acquisition such a setting. The research team will implement, deploy, and evaluate the resulting algorithms using benchmark data sets, associated data models and ontologies, and user-specified inter-ontology mappings on a distributed test-bed of networked databases and services at Iowa State University and Kansas State University. The resulting open-source software can potentially transform collaborative e-science in the same way that Web has transformed information sharing. Broader impacts of this research include enhanced opportunities for research-based training of graduate and undergraduate students, interdisciplinary collaborations, participation of under-represented groups, and development of increasingly sophisticated software to support collaborative, integrative e-science. The project web site (http://www.cild.iastate.edu/projects/indus.html) provides access to information about the project, benchmark data, publications, software, and documentation.</Abstract>

<Abstract>It is natural that events of interest in observed scenes manifest themselves across multiple sensing modalities - vision, hearing, smell, etc. The remarkable perceptions of audio-video signals by natural systems, such as humans, also points to superiority of inferences drawn across modalities. It, therefore, seems natural to enhance performance of automated systems by using joint, cross-modal statistical inferences. However, the detection, organization, and understanding of cues and events in real-world scenarios are difficult tasks. This project seeks to develop a pattern-theoretic framework for achieving these goals. The main research items are: (1) development of mathematical quantities to represent audio and visual events and their spatiotemporal relations, (2) use domain-specific ontologies to impose semantic structure and to incorporate prior knowledge, and (3) derive algorithms for Bayesian inferences using efficient adaptations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The use of pattern theory allows bridging of gaps between raw signals and high-level, domain-dependent semantics, and helps discovers large groups of audio-visual events likely to represent the same underlying event. This effort combines ideas from perceptual organization in computer vision, computational analysis of auditory signals, pattern theory, and prior developments in ontological structures. The methods developed here are applicable to many scenarios that deploy audio and video sensors, including problems of audio annotations of videos, speaker tracking in teleconferencing, and separation of multiple objects in remote surveillance. Broader impact activities involve the development of teaching modules, innovation and entrepreneurial training of the students, and communication of the findings to the community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;From representation to learning to inference, effective use of high-level semantic knowledge in computer vision remains a challenge in bridging the signal-symbol gap. This research investigates the role of semantics in visual inference through the generalized image understanding problem: to automatically detect, localize, segment, and recognize the core high-level elements and how they interact in an image, and provide a parsimonious semantic description of the image.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Specifically, this research examines a unified methodology that integrates low- (e.g., pixels and features), mid- (e.g. latent structure), and high-level (e.g., semantics) elements for visual inference. Adaptive graph hierarchies induced directly from the images provide the core mathematical representation. A statistical interpretation of affinities between neighboring pixels and regions in the image drives this induction. Latent elements and structure are captured with multilevel Markov networks. A probabilistic ontology represents the core knowledge and uncertainty of the inferred structure and guides the ultimate semantic interpretation of the image. At each level, rigorous methods from computer science and statistics are connected to and combined with formal semantic methods from philosophy.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A symbiotic education plan involving graduate and undergraduate mentoring and education, professional tutorial courses at the boundary of vision and ontology, and K-12 outreach is incorporated into the research plan. The research and education, disseminated broadly through both the applied science and semantics/philosophy literatures, lays a foundation on which to both utilize and automatically extract rich semantic information from images and other signal data for critical application areas such as internet vision, autonomous navigation, and ambient biometrics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>&amp;quot;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Florida State University, University of Texas at Austin and the University of Kansas are collaborating to create a distributed information system that integrates image-based morphological data to improve species and specimen identification. In order to accomplish this, the project combines three existing information resources including; digital image repositories (Morphbank), biological collection management systems (Specify) and ontology management systems (Morphster). The interoperability of these systems will be leveraged to enable the integration of a wide variety of large and small repositories of biological information. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project creates an economic model that leads to long-term stability. The benefit to the biodiversity research community will be the increased ease of collection, organization, management, and sharing of research information and the increased ease of discovering and re-purposing information from other research projects.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by coordinating the use of the three projects to create a rich example of morphological data, based on specimens and images, which will improve the quality of specimen identifications and provide greater uniformity in the application of terms from ontologies. The project team will illustrate a character state data matrix for the 520 southeastern US species of legumes using specimen metadata in Specify and images in Morphbank. The legacy character and state descriptions will be incorporated into Morphster ontologies and tied to image annotations in Morphbank. These annotations will be available to users of all three systems, so that researchers will be able to find specimens for their research needs. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The images and annotations found in Morphbank (http://www.morphbank.net), the specimen data in Specify (http://specifysoftware.org), and the ontology browsing capabilities of Morphster (http://morphster.org) provide valuable resources for educators and tools for communication between the scientific community and the public. This project will foster and augment these inherent strengths in collaboration with the Brogan Museum of Arts and Sciences (Tallahassee, FL). The combined systems will be valuable tools for those interested in identifying unknown organisms, including species that are potentially toxic, invasive, endangered, or sensitive environmental indicators.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A wide diversity of microbes live on or in the tissues of plants, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes and fungus-like organisms called oomycetes. All of these microbes, whether beneficial or pathogenic (disease-causing), have developed mechanisms to neutralize the defense systems used by plants to protect themselves against infection. Understanding the similarities in the ways these diverse microbes attack plants will help us understand the vulnerabilities of plants to infection, which will in turn help design new and effective methods for controlling plant disease. Currently, genome projects focused on a variety of plant pathogenic microbes are uncovering large numbers of genes that the microbes may use to attack plants. However, because these genome projects are going on in different research communities, the terminology that is used to describe the functions of the genes varies so much that it is very difficult to compare the functions of genes in the different microbes. This project will establish a standardized set of terms, called a Gene Ontology, for describing the functions of genes used by microbes that live in or on plants, including pathogenic microbes. The work of establishing the terms will be carried out in collaboration with the Gene Ontology Consortium, which is a group of institutions involved in creating standardized terms for describing all the functions of genes in living organisms.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact of this work will be to establish a means for greatly facilitating the exchange of information among researchers studying plant-associated microbes. The work will also be of value to researchers studying animal- and human-microbe interactions. Members of many different research communities will be trained in the use of the standardized terms, through training workshops, internships, presentations at meetings, and on-line training documents. Training will emphasize graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty, especially those who are minorities, or are from undergraduate institutions. Information about the standardized terms will also be incorporated into courses for graduate and undergraduate students.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is being supported through a collaboration of the National Science Foundation and the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative Research, Education, and Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Collaborative Research: Language Processing Technology for Electronic Rulemaking &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Many people today, including news analysts, opinion pollsters, advertisers, and government regulation writers need to interpret, structure, and rapidly master large quantities of opinion-based text. New research is needed to develop text-processing tools that can perform advanced analysis of large text collections. This research will build on current text processing technologies, such as text clustering, text searching using information retrieval, and extractive summaries, to build and test tools tailored to the specific needs of government personnel working in an electronic rulemaking environment. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project&amp;apos;s focus is the federal government&amp;apos;s several-thousand regulation writers, employed in some 200 agencies, who formulate, in a tightly scripted procedure, the rules and regulations that define the details of our laws. This project will attempt to solve several novel problems central to language processing research. In turn, it will deploy and evaluate a Rule-Writer&amp;apos;s Workbench; a set of language tools that enables regulation writers, singly or jointly, to obtain a detailed and multidimensional overview of the material. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research has the potential to impact far beyond IT and social science academia. It will explore such novel issues as author typing, opinion/affect determination, and near-duplicate detection. If even just a handful of the new technologies are effective, they eventually may help thousands of regulation writers more effectively communicate with and understand the comments of millions of citizens in our increasingly digitized society, and produce better regulatory rules for all of us.</Abstract>

The project team will illustrate a character state data matrix for the 520 southeastern US species of legumes using specimen metadata in Specify and images in Morphbank. The legacy character and state descriptions will be incorporated into Morphster ontologies and tied to image annotations in Morphbank. These annotations will be available to users of all three systems, so that researchers will be able to find specimens for their research needs. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The images and annotations found in Morphbank (http://www.morphbank.net), the specimen data in Specify (http://specifysoftware.org), and the ontology browsing capabilities of Morphster (http://morphster.org) provide valuable resources for educators and tools for communication between the scientific community and the public. This project will foster and augment these inherent strengths in collaboration with the Brogan Museum of Arts and Sciences (Tallahassee, FL).

<Abstract>This exploratory research focuses on the development of algorithms for integrating spatial and temporal annotations over natural language text, thereby enabling the tracking of entities through space and time. This involves the use of lexical resources and the integration of two existing annotation schemes to create a representation capturing the movement of individuals through spatial and temporal locations. This representation is extracted automatically from documents using symbolic and machine learning methods.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This work builds on technologies that have emerged recently that parse the temporal structure of narratives. These techniques use the TimeML markup language to combine rule-based systems, machine learning, and temporal reasoning, and a markup scheme called SpatialML to map relative and absolute locations to geo-coordinates. Data structures from these schemes are then integrated with a representation of event arguments. Using a verb lexicon that captures the meaning of motion verbs, information about the participants involved in events described by such verbs is captured. Finally, these markup representations are mapped onto the appropriate ontological categories within the Standardized Upper Model Ontology (SUMO). &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results of this exploratory research are potentially significant, as there has to date been little research done on integrating spatial information extraction with other aspects of text understanding. Furthermore, by providing a mapping of the representations of temporal and spatial annotations over natural language texts to a standardized ontology such as SUMO, we hope to provide interoperability of resources to the community, while also leveraging the work done within the ontology research community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This STTR Phase II project aims to produce a software application that dramatically improves a manager&amp;apos;s ability to allocate resources to productive uses. With advances in Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and ontology technology, the tool has the potential to enable the discovery of future supply and demand imbalances for teams of business analysts. The objective is to produce at least one Investable Inconsistency per day by the end of the research period. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Phase I project produced unanticipated innovations that may have broad utility in both the OLAP field and the ontology field, and with these innovations, the software platform shows promise for transforming the essential practice of analysis in the field of market research in support of investment decisions. The Phase II project, if successful will result in technology that extends this promise to a broad audience, educating users in best practices for investment analysis and enabling them to materially improve their allocation of resources.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This exploratory project investigates the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for facilitating curation and ontological development efforts of model organism databases. This research will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by increasing the productivity of curators and using computerized methods to assist in development of a standardized ontology of biomolecular relations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will address the following issues through a series of studies: a) what types of information are needed to actually reduce the work of curators, b) how should that information be presented, c) how much effort can actually be saved, and d) what level of performance is required? The studies will be performed utilizing curators and an existing NLP relation extraction system called GENIES that was shown to perform effectively.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will also investigate how output from an NLP relation extraction system (GENIES) can be used to develop a standardized ontology of relations. This will involve exploration of how to organize and visualize the extracted relations for ontological work. The utility of a flexible XML-based visualization tool that allows users to view relations according to different dimensions, such as by agent, by target, or by frequency will be explored.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Data Protection laws that exempt data that is not individually &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;identifiable have led to an explosion in anonymization research. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Unfortunately, how well current de-identification and anonymization &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques control risks to privacy and confidentiality is not well &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;understood. Neither is the usefulness of anonymized data for real-world &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;applications. The project addresses anonymization on three fronts: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) Textual data, even when explicit identifiers are removed (names, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;dates, locations), can contain highly identifiable information. For &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;example, a sample of chief complaint fields from the Indiana Network &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for Patient Care (INPC) found several instances of &amp;quot;phantom limb &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;pain&amp;quot;. Amputees can be visually identifiable, but the HIPAA Safe &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Harbor rules do not list this as &amp;quot;identifying information&amp;quot;. Any &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;policy explicitly listing all types of identifying data is likely to &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;fail. Through a joint effort with computer science and linguistics, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the project is developing new methods to remove specific details from &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;text while preserving meaning, eliminating such highly identifiable &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information without a priori knowledge of what would be identifying. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) Current anonymization research is based on unproven measures of &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;identifiability. Through a re-identification challenge on synthetic &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;data (but based on real healthcare data), the project is evaluating &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the efficacy of these measures. Interdisciplinary teams of students &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;are given challenge problems - anonymized data with hypothetical &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;healthcare data - and asked to make (hypothetical) inferences about &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;health information of individuals. The results can be used to &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;calibrate the effectiveness of different anonymization measures. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) The utility of anonymized data has been a concern among research: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Does anonymized data provide credible research results? By partnering &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;with healthcare studies at the Kinsey Institute and Purdue University &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;School of Nursing, the project is comparing analyses on original data &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;with analyses on anonymized data, and evaluating the impact of types &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of anonymization on research results. A related issue is determining &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the impact on data collection: Are individuals more candid in their &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;responses if they know data will be anonymized? Outcomes are broadening &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the scope of research that can be performed on anonymized data, while &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ensuring that researchers know when access to individually identifiable &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;data (with attendant restrictions and safeguards) is needed. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Through these tasks, the project is advancing our ability to utilize &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the wealth of data we now collect for the benefit of society, while &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ensuring individual privacy is protected. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/TextAnon</Abstract>

<Abstract>One central information technology problem of the next decade will be the creation of a means through which to query a heterogeneous set of life science databases, generally via the Internet. Life science web databases hold information that is critical to researchers. Even though, in the above databases, data have been collected and automated procedures for data manipulation have been provided, user accessibility to such databases is very often still inadequate due to the lack of a comparable data representation, a unified interface for data exchange among the databases, and a customizable infrastructure (i.e. support for views) that addresses the individual needs of scientists. The research objective of this career plan is to address these issues by developing an information integration system for life science databases that supports views (BACIIS+ Biological and Chemical Information Integration System Plus -- views). &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;BACIIS+ will allow for better communication between life science databases, will provide for continuous and rapid expansion and adaptation to the evolving biological field, and will provide better and more customizable approaches for data access and data analysis through dynamic views. The open research issues involved in the development of BACIIS+ include : 1) the management of large data sets, 2) the interoperability of geographically distributed autonomous databases, 3) the seamless semantic-based integration of these databases with total transparency to the user, and 4) the support for distributed multi-database views. Semantic integration aims at integrating data in a meaningful way while syntactic integration consists of just collecting and pasting together data from different databases. Static views consist of a limited set of views predefined in scope. Whereas dynamic views are created on-demand and their scope is completely defined by the user. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Two new graduate courses are planned: Life science information systems, and Computational biology algorithms. The first course will cover the complexity of information extraction and management in the context of life science data. The second course will cover the foundation of sequential and parallel algorithms for sequence similarity analysis. Collaborators from Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Company and Dow AgroSciences are involved in the courses, providing industry perspectives. The proposed courses build on a current course by the PI that covers advanced molecular biology and includes three major sections: bioinformatics, computational modeling, and molecular machinery. The plan actively seeks the participation of undergraduate and minority students through senior design projects. A campus-wide bioinformatics initiative includes a newly established School of Informatics and the Indiana Genomics Center. An international workshop on the interoperability of life science databases is in development.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Development of high throughput data acquisition technologies together with advances in computing, and communications have resulted in an explosive growth in the number, size, and diversity of potentially useful information sources. However, the massive size, heterogeneity, autonomy, and distributed nature of the data repositories present significant hurdles in extracting knowledge from this data. This research seeks to overcome these hurdles through the design, analysis, and implementation of:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;a) Efficient distributed and cumulative learning algorithms with provable performance guarantees (relative to their centralized or batch counterparts) for knowledge acquisition from distributed data sources;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;b) Customizable information extraction agents that can effectively exploit domain or context-specific ontologies supplied by the users to extract the information needed for learning (e.g., statistics) from distributed data sources despite differences in query capabilities, interfaces, ontologies, and access restrictions to facilitate analysis of heterogeneous distributed data from different perspectives.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;c) INDUS - a test-bed for knowledge acquisition from heterogeneous distributed data in computational molecular biology (e.g., characterization of protein sequence-structure-function relationships using diverse sources of biological data).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The resulting algorithms and software can accelerate, potentially by an order of magnitude, the rate of scientific</Abstract>

The solutions to these complex problems require organizations within a country as well as across national boundaries to effectively and efficiently share, not only heterogeneous data, but also knowledge captured in different knowledge representation schemes and application systems to support their problem-solving and decision-making in highly distributed and dynamic environments. This project will develop the infrastructure and technologies for the processing and management of 1) distributed events, 2) dynamic data associated with event occurrences, and 3) knowledge expressed by different types of rules and rule structures (multi-faceted knowledge) and application system operations invoked by rules. The context for this research is the USDA&amp;apos;s National Plant Diagnostics Network (NPDN), a network established for rapid detection of crop disease and pest outbreaks. NPDN&amp;apos;s goal is to enable many collaborating organizations to receive data associated with each occurrence of an event type as well as data generated by different types of rules and rule structures, and application operations triggered by the event. This will support the local decision-making, problem-solving and activity coordination of collaborating organizations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The expected results include 1) an extended rule markup language and user interface tools for defining events and capturing multi-faceted knowledge, 2) techniques for efficient and effective management and processing of distributed, heterogeneous events, event data, triggers and rules, 3) a domain ontology for plant disease diagnostics and techniques for ontology management, 4) an extended Web Service infrastructure with an ontology-enhanced and constraint-based registry for semantic discovery of triggers, rules and application operations that are uniformly modeled and published as Web Services, and 5) the deployment of the developed tools and system at several regional centers of the NPDN for application and evaluation of the R&amp;amp;D results.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual merits: First, the extended Rule Markup Language will contribute to the effort of the RuleML community in developing a standard language for organizations to specify and share policies, regulations, processes and constraints expressed in terms of high-level declarative rules. Second, the resulting techniques, algorithms, methodologies and infrastructure will significantly advance the state of arts of information and knowledge management. Third, the proposed ontology-enhanced and constraint-based Web Service registry will significantly improve the quality of discovery and invocation of registered rules, rule structures, and application system operations. By converting heterogeneous rules and rule structures into Web Services, all that will be needed is a single rule server that invokes them as Web Services to achieve collaborative problem-solving.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: First, the R&amp;amp;D results will be applied and evaluated by a federation of collaborating organizations in the NPDN environment. The deployment of the resulting collaborative system and tools will have an immediate application to and impact on the NPDN organization because they will be timely informed of any disease or pest outbreak and receive guided assistance on appropriate emergency response resulting from the application of knowledge rules. Second, events, multifaceted knowledge specifications and application operations registered in the Web Service registry will capture collaborating organizations&amp;apos; policies, regulations, processes and constraints for later education and training uses.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The objective of this work is to extend significantly the capabilities of portals created by the geospatial community, by providing semantic integration over diverse data sets. For example, the Wisconsin Land Information System and the new Federal Geospatial One-Stop portals disseminate data and support procedures and simulations in emergency situations. However, geospatial data are complex and highly heterogeneous, having been developed independently by various levels of government and the private sector. This project includes metadata integration methods to enable more precise location of data sources over the web and to provide geospatial portals with query capabilities and semantic resolution for the types of information integration that could help in information discovery, problem-solving, or emergency response.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research will develop methods and tools to support the integration of information in such a way that end users will have a homogeneous view over heterogeneous data sources. An ontology-based architecture will be developed with which each individual heterogeneous data source can be added to the network of information with relatively little effort. Ontology mappings will establish correspondences between terms in heterogeneous sources and those of standard models and ontologies. The approach also extends ontology mappings to incorporate semantics regarding spatial considerations, such as accuracy, for spatial integration.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Information integration is an area of research that stretches over databases, artificial intelligence, digital libraries, and the semantic web. This project will extend significantly the state of the art of information integration in general and of geospatial information integration in particular, by providing a robust and scalable framework that encompasses techniques and algorithms for integrating heterogeneous data sources using an ontology-based approach.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project&amp;apos;s goal of semantic integration for geospatial data fits into a broad vision for creating a cyberinfrastructure on the Web. In a geospatial cyberinfrastructure, data will be automatically located and semantically matched to other relevant data sources. Manual intervention will not be needed or will be minimal. With such a structure, emergency managers, government officials, and the general public will not be constrained to pre-formulated queries. Instead, ad hoc, exploratory queries and analyses will be possible. From an educational viewpoint, the project will significantly benefit the training of graduate and undergraduate students, in particular of women and minorities, and will include the design of new graduate and undergraduate courses.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Award: 0956010&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI: Mark Parsons&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Project Title: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Community-based Data Interoperability (INTEROP)International Network of Arctic Knowledge (INAK)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Rapid Arctic change has critical implications for global climate, biodiversity, geopolitics, international transportation, and local society. To understand and respond to this change and its implications, it is necessary to understand the Arctic as a system. The International Polar Year (IPY) was a huge international effort to improve our interdisciplinary understanding of the Arctic and Polar Regions, how they are changing, and their impact on the Earth system and human society. IPY produced a large, diverse array of data that increases the challenge of interdisciplinary data discovery and use. The data is enriched, but the challenge is increased, by the explicit inclusion of social science research and local and traditional knowledge of the Arctic. Yet, IPY and the rapid change in the Arctic have generated considerable international resolve and formal collaboration that can be harnessed to improve the semantic understanding and interoperability of Arctic data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;NSIDC, working with domain and community-building experts at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and elsewhere, use the opportunity of IPY and the developing Polar Information Commons to improve the knowledge and interoperability of sea ice and related Arctic data through the extension and enhancement of an international data management network. Through focused workshops and broad community interaction, a formal, sea-ice ontology, and an expansive interdisciplinary knowledge framework for the Arctic are developed. Proven and maturing semantic web methodologies and ontology creation tools, including visual tools like concept maps, are used to develop the underlying infrastructure. The support and ongoing evolution of this infrastructure relies on the engagement of the people and communities who use, enhance, and maintain that infrastructure?the INAK. The need for interdisciplinary understanding of the Arctic system (driven by the profound changes in the Arctic) motivates the network, and the occasion of the IPY provides a unique opportunity and mechanism to develop the network, but ultimately, the network is sustained when members see how their network activities benefit their immediate scientific and practical science needs. The project engages the diverse Arctic community, including Arctic residents and indigenous people, to contribute to and use the INAK. Ultimately, the ontologies go beyond direct data user needs and grow the INAK and Arctic semantic insights into the future.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will furnish several &amp;apos;building blocks&amp;apos; for data interoperability within linguistics and all disciplines which use language data. The work will be based on the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD), a machine-readable information structure which allows allows computers to process and &amp;apos;understand&amp;apos; linguistic concepts and the relations among them. Using GOLD, the project will develop an extensive network of ontology-aware lexical items drawn from sixteen different projects and over 3000 languages. Thus, computers will be able to understand the relationship between linguistic categories across languages, and interpret what their linguistic function is when they appear in texts. In addition, the project will develop a set of low-barrier data requirements which lexicon creators can implement in order to join this ontology-based network. It will also create architecture to integrate network data into frameworks developed by major international standards initiatives. Finally, the project will establish DevSpace, an online facility designed to promote continuing information- and resource-sharing among linguists and developers interested in augmenting the network with additional tools and services.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Such a project is important because cross-linguistic language data is central to many research communities. Language history and language comparison can provide critical insights into the genetics, culture, migrations, and contacts of human populations. And natural language data is indispensable to major computational research initiatives, such as multilingual text processing. In providing linguistically interpreted lexical data from so many underdescribed languages, LEGO will ultimately aid in meaning extraction from texts even of languages far too small to justify a full-scale natural language processing system. Thus from both a computational perspective and a Humanities and Social Sciences perspective, the LEGO project will create a research resource of remarkable breadth and diversity, one which will serve multiple disciplines.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal describes prototype development for a Virtual Solar-Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO), a shared distributed infrastructure for the solar-terrestrial physics community. The VSTO, through ontology and schema development, web portal and analysis tool provision, and data assimilation tools, will enable mining and processing of large distributed data sets in a grid environment linking together compute and storage resources at NCAR to the solar-terrestrial physics community. The targeted user field of science is solar, solar-terrestrial, and space physics (SSTSP).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impact and intellectual merit extend across the main technical work areas: ontology development will allow for new integration and merging of existing semantic metadata in an interdisciplinary setting with resulting tool creation for ontologies and their upkeep; data assimilation techniques will be developed and applied by leveraging ongoing efforts at NCAR, such as the Virtual Solar Observatory; and at the system level serve as an operational prototype for a new distributed cyberinfrastructure serving a broader community dealing with space weather activities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is linking and integrating multi-media teaching materials (slides, videos and textbooks) used in Information Security courses based on a security ontology. The semantic linking of the multimedia course materials allows students to search and compose multimedia and interactive course materials based on the content, medium and learning styles, enabling flexible personalized learning. To achieve these goals, the project is focusing on several research tasks: (1) Segmenting and annotating learning media based on their learning content, (2) Building a Security ontology to be used for annotating and querying of the learning objects, (3) Adapting lecture content to student learning styles, and (4) Evaluating the usability and effectiveness of the linked multimedia security learning system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The technology and methodology that is being developed by this project, including the ontology builder for a given learning topic, the semantic segmentation of multimedia learning objects, the search, and personalization of learning objects, can be adapted to any course. The outcome of this project helps students build upon existing knowledge as they are being introduced to unfamiliar material, by creating subject specific searches of all course content. This changes the way students learn by making course content more organized, interactive, and instantly accessible while adding individualization options. Students are able to fill gaps in their previous learning instantly by integrating search results into their current studying. By having instant access to learning, and experiencing a truly interactive, individualized learning environment, students are less likely to be overwhelmed by course materials.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project seeks to explore biomolecules in the context of networks of different biological pathways. The methods are built upon a combination of two complementary technologies, BioPAX and Instance Store. BioPAX is an emerging standard for the representation of biological pathway data exchange such as metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks. It is an ontology written in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that describes genes, proteins, enzymes, and small molecules. Statements in OWL have a precise meaning and the strong formalism enables a collection of statements made in OWL to be reasoned over, as well as checked for consistency and contradictions. Instance Store takes an ontology and the data it describes formally in OWL and uses reasoning technology to ask question and make inferences about these data. Using the two technologies together should enable seamless integration of a number of data sources and facilitate the creation of tools.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Understanding and reasoning over pathway data will enhance life science and medical research, as well as environmental research such as bioremediation. It will also facilitate the development of semantic web technologies because of the data and use cases provided by the life sciences and be part of the World Wide Web consortium Life Science Initiative.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of Califorina - San Francisco is awarded a grant develop resources and tools for identifying and repairing misannotations of molecular functions for the huge numbers of enzymes discovered in the genome projects and represented in public databases. The project extends previously developed theory and computational methods that have been used to describe superfamilies of enzymes whose structures and sequences look similar but whose functions can be very different, leading to high levels of misannotation when these structural similarities are used to infer similarity of function. This project will produce an ontology, e.g., rules that can be applied generally, describing misannotations, as well as software tools for updating annotations, a reference database of known misanotations, and online training materials to assist end users and database curators in handling misannotations. The ontology, database, and software tools will be integrated into an existing Structure-Function Linkage Database developed and maintained by the PI at the University of California - San Francisco.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Creation of a general ontology of misannotation of enzymes will provide a broadly applicable resource for assuring the quality of functional annotations in public sequence and structural databases. For experimental biologists especially, this work will provide resources, stand-alone tools, and online tutorials to help them identify problems in annotations of enzymes with which they work and correct those problems to improve the overall quality of their research.</Abstract>

During the course of this project, a common set of controlled vocabulary terms describing anatomical structures and developmental stages of the flowering and non-flowering plants will be developed. This will produce resolution to the divergences between the numerous terminologies used by different genomics projects and the nomenclatures used for various plant parts as described classically by plant taxonomists and anatomists as well as across other botanical subdisciplines. The standardization of definitions and naming of the vocabulary terms in the PO that describe either a plant structure or developmental stage provides a framework for fostering consistency in describing gene expression profiles and observed phenotypic traits. The consistent use of PO in descriptions, allows plant biologists and breeders to make meaningful cross-database and cross-species queries to discover patterns of similarities and dissimilarities, and discover the nature of evolutionary innovations. Also, it will allow the examination of the functions of genes and the genetic interactions associated with plant developmental processes and their contribution to agronomic and commercially significant phenotypic traits, such as improved disease resistance and biomass yield. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project website is http://www.plantontology.org. All the contents and results of the project will be released to the public from this website resource. The project outreach program will organize teachers&amp;apos; training workshops and exhibits for students and general public. The focus of these workshops/exhibits will be Plant Biology awareness.</Abstract>

The workshop is co-sponsored by the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Partial support has been promised by Turkish, European Commission, Canadian and Japanese agencies. While it is broadly recognized that infrastructures are multi-domain and multi-disciplinary systems with human, natural and engineered elements, there is currently little awareness and no consensus regarding how innovative paradigms and concepts need to be integrated and leveraged to advance the engineering and management of infrastructures in general and transportation infrastructures in particular. The principal intellectual merit of the workshop will be to bring experts and stakeholders that have so far remained apart, in order to start bridging this gap by leveraging highways and bridges for a realistic case study. The highway transportation infrastructure, its linkages and interdependencies to other modes of transportation and other infrastructures will be leveraged as this case study. Turkey is at the cross-roads between Europe and Asia, and the highway infrastructure connecting Asia and Europe at Istanbul will serve as an excellent backdrop for the discussions. Specific objectives of the workshop include: (1) To bring a multi-disciplinary group of engineers and scientists from academe, government and industry together for discussing how innovative paradigms and concepts may be integrated and leveraged to advance the engineering and management of infrastructures in general, and highway transportation infrastructure in particular. The workshop will explore the inter-relations and synergies between the concepts and paradigms of asset management, performance-based engineering, multihazards risks, multi-domain systems identification, applied systems analysis, health monitoring and intelligent systems in addition to interdependence, resilience and sustainability. (2) To construct Ontology of PBIAM of highway transportation infrastructure to help overcome the fragmentation that is obstructing effective integration and leveraging of concepts and paradigms with potential to innovate engineering and management of infrastructures. Ontology has been leveraged as a mechanism for creating a community sharing a similar worldview and speaking the same language in order to foster highly complex emerging fields of study that face integration challenges. Space, defense, AI, IT are examples. (3) To develop an International Collaborative Research Agenda on PBIAM. This Agenda will incorporate an in-depth understanding and sharing of recent experiences and advances on PBIAM in Europe, the Far East and North America. It will also permit an understanding of how different social and cultural institutions and related human systems in different regions of the world impact PBIAM applications.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;No one country or region has yet discovered the best and most effective framework for efficient, safe, sustainable and secure operation and preservation of their infrastructures. The path to innovation has to go through global, coordinated, multi-domain, and multi-disciplinary research. This workshop was conceived in this manner and the Ontology and PBIAM Research Agenda will be broadly disseminated through a web site linked to FHWA&amp;apos;s site to promote the adoption of PBIAM principles by transportation infrastructure stewards throughout the US. To facilitate the participation of experts from traditionally underrepresented groups in these workshops, several strategies will be employed. First, leading civil engineering faculty and practitioners from traditionally underrepresented groups will be directly contacted by the workshop organizing committee and invited to participate in the workshop. To aid in the identification of qualified faculty and advanced graduate students, the Philadelphia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, which is housed at Drexel University will be leveraged. To aid in the identification of practitioners from underrepresented groups, faculty members and national leaders associated with professional societies that serve underrepresented groups, will be contacted and asked to nominate qualified participants.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</Abstract>

<Abstract>ABSTRACT&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;NSF-0542041&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Luciano, Joanne S.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project seeks to explore biomolecules in the context of networks of different biological pathways. The methods are built upon a combination of two complementary technologies, BioPAX and Instance Store. BioPAX is an emerging standard for the representation of biological pathway data exchange such as metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks. It is an ontology written in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that describes genes, proteins, enzymes, and small molecules. Statements in OWL have a precise meaning and the strong formalism enables a collection of statements made in OWL to be reasoned over, as well as checked for consistency and contradictions. Instance Store takes an ontology and the data it describes formally in OWL and uses reasoning technology to ask question and make inferences about these data. Using the two technologies together should enable seamless integration of a number of data sources and facilitate the creation of tools. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Understanding and reasoning over pathway data will enhance life science and medical research, as well as environmental research such as bioremediation. It will also facilitate the development of semantic web technologies because of the data and use cases provided by the life sciences and be part of the World Wide Web consortium Life Science Initiative.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Scholars from a range of disciplines long have sought to understand relationships between visual representations and linguistic categories of landscape elements. One line of inquiry has sought to address the question: Do speakers of different languages think in different concepts, or is thinking more nearly universal and language more superficial? This collaborative research project will investigate how people conceptualize the natural landscape and how they relate to it. The project will investigate landscape terminology used by some indigenous communities living in arid landscapes. Language will be a major focus of the research. The project will study both the generic terms that the people use to refer to elements of the landscape and also the ways that the people describe the landscape in their traditional narratives. The research will examine how members of three cultural and linguistic groups subdivide, classify, and talk about their landscapes. The three groups are the Navajo (Dine) of northern Arizona and New Mexico, the Hopi of northern Arizona, and the Yindjibarndi of the northwestern part of Western Australia. Project researchers will conduct in-depth interviews with expert consultants within the three communities regarding the vocabulary for referring to landforms, water bodies, and other geographic features. Researchers will express the definitions within a formal ontology of the landscape and will confirm the definitions and term lists by compiling pictorial dictionaries. The researchers and consultants also will recruit young members of these indigenous communities to take photographs of significant aspects of the landscape, discuss the content of these photographs with elders, and report results. Photographs of these landscapes also will be shown to English-speaking undergraduate subjects to provide baseline interpretations for English language terminology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will investigate the degree to which the apparent structure of the landscape depends upon the raw facts of physical reality, how much of the structure arises due to the nature of human perception and other aspects of cognition, and how much of the structure is determined by culture, language, and lifestyle. These are fundamental issues in the behavioral and cognitive sciences for all knowledge domains, yet they hardly have been address with respect to the landscape. The research seeks to understand the close yet different interconnections among culture, history, spirituality, and landscape for each of the cultural groups. One goal of the research is to characterize these peoples&amp;apos; landscape categories and terminology with sufficient precision and rigor to allow geographic information systems (GIS) to detect, manipulate, and reason about the categories and the entities belonging to them. Some of the tribes, including the Navajo and Hopi, currently are using commercial GIS to manage tribal lands, but it appears that the software cannot readily incorporate traditional knowledge and integrate such knowledge with technoscience data from government sources. Lessons learned in this project will guide future work on cross-cultural interoperability of geographic information systems and will contribute to the design of databases and GISs that can be used by speakers of different natural languages both within their communities and for joint management of lands and landscapes. Pictorial dictionaries of landscape terminology also will provide the tribes and cultures in question with material that may contribute to cultural preservation through use in the schools and other outlets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Colorado State University is awarded a grant to develop machine learning methods for predicting protein function. The availability of protein function annotations supports the everyday work of biologists in multiple areas---from biomedical discovery to the study of plant drought resistance, and the design of bacteria useful in biofuel production. Assigning function to proteins in sequenced genomes is a major undertaking, and with new organisms being sequenced daily, experimentally determining the function of all the proteins in those organisms is not practical, requiring computational assignment of function to proteins that have not been studied in the lab. Computational scientists have been considering the problem of function prediction for over two decades. Yet, the basic methodology for protein function prediction has not changed much during this time and remains that of &amp;quot;annotation transfer&amp;quot; from proteins with a known function using a method for sequence comparison such as BLAST. Protein function prediction has several properties that make it difficult to apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to this problem, such as the large number of potential functions (thousands of possible terms), the fact that proteins can have multiple functions, and the hierarchical relationship between terms in the Gene Ontology (GO), which is the standard system of keywords used to describe protein function. In this work the problem of annotating proteins with GO terms will be explicitly modeled as a hierarchical classification problem using the methodology of &amp;quot;kernel methods for structured outputs&amp;quot;, which allows the modeling of complex prediction problems. This methodology will allow the PIs to integrate a variety of genomic information - sequence data, gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and information mined from the biological literature. The award will lead to a function prediction method with state-of-the-art accuracy. The project will have broad impact by providing the GOstruct method to the bioinformatics and biology communities in the form of downloadable software and an online-accessible function prediction server. Education will be impacted through the incorporation of the tool into new courses in programming for biologists and on kernel methods.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is developing methods and tools for ordinary web content creators to indicate the structure inherent in their content by drawing a few simple lines or figures over their web site. Their motivation for doing so is to use enhanced browsing and searching capabilities in their local site based on these mappings. These new browsing and searching capabilities are based on the definition of canonical structures (i.e., data model fragments) and domain patterns (a set of instantiated canonical structures) with associated navigation and access paths where domain patterns are easily recognizable by content creators and easily articulated using a simple drawing approach. This work is complementary to yet distinct from much existing effort to transition to a more semantic Web; the focus here is on (simple) local specification (drawing) of mappings with local benefit. This project uses a form of crowd-sourcing to create ontology mappings and (indirectly) create ontologies. This project applies decades of work on data modeling and schema mapping but with structural fragments rather than complete schemas/ontologies, without view update problems (because of the focus on browsing/searching), and with immediate local benefit. The research is motivated by and will be showcased in a series of websites that support public access to instructional materials. In general, this work is expected to contribute (nearly effortlessly yet in a high-quality way) to achieving the vision for the semantic web.</Abstract>

Interactive visualization provides a visual metaphor for understanding complicated concepts and uncovering the dynamics of processes that are hidden. An emerging and active application area for visualization research is visualization of program execution in Computer and Information Science (CIS) education, particularly in the context of machine level languages, high-level languages, and algorithms and data structures. This project focuses on promising approaches to useful visualization called engaging visualization, explanatory visualization, and adaptive visualization and attempts to answer the following research questions pertaining to visualization: What is the value of adaptation and explanation in the context of program visualization? Will visualization enhancement technologies produce better understanding of programming concepts? Can recent advancements in model-based generation and centralized student modeling produce efficient and scaleable adaptive explanatory visualization? Can adaptive explanatory visualization help teach the most challenging parts of programming-oriented courses? Starting with a proof-of-concept system the research team develops a set of practical tools based on adaptive explanatory visualization and examines their effectiveness in classroom studies at both partner institutions.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal describes prototype development for a Virtual Solar-Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO), a shared distributed infrastructure for the solar-terrestrial physics community. The VSTO, through ontology and schema development, web portal and analysis tool provision, and data assimilation tools, will enable mining and processing of large distributed data sets in a grid environment linking together compute and storage resources at NCAR to the solar-terrestrial physics community. The targeted user field of science is solar, solar-terrestrial, and space physics (SSTSP).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impact and intellectual merit extend across the main technical work areas: ontology development will allow for new integration and merging of existing semantic metadata in an interdisciplinary setting with resulting tool creation for ontologies and their upkeep; data assimilation techniques will be developed and applied by leveraging ongoing efforts at NCAR, such as the Virtual Solar Observatory; and at the system level serve as an operational prototype for a new distributed cyberinfrastructure serving a broader community dealing with space weather activities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This workshop of indigenous scholars and others will explore the creation of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) based on indigenous ontology. The focus of the workshop is to discuss the possibility of new ways to format Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and Remote Sensing (RS) technology for managing spatial data by drawing upon the spatial knowledge systems imbedded in the cultural principles, practices, and protocols of many indigenous groups. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PIs and CoPIs are PhD scientists from diverse indigenous groups, Alaska Native, American Indian, Maori, and Hawaiian, and the workshop attendees will include scholars from these, as well as other groups. The expertise assembled will be cartography, cultural ecology, anthropology, oral history, computer science, GIS technology, human geography, linguistics, and medical sciences. Participants will be invited through an open call for participation that will include Indigenous academics and cultural leaders, social scientists, computer scientists, SDI specialist, and others with relevant knowledge and interest; special attention will be made to reach out to new career scientists from underrepresented groups. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Pointing to other international efforts (ESRI Conservation Program, Aboriginal Mapping network, Indigenous Mapping Network, and the Integrated Approaches to Participatory Development Project) where indigenous communities are engaging with spatial technologies in order to map their territories in a way they feel reflects their own knowledge, the research team successfully argues that there is potential to explore a different way of organizing spatial data. The organizers point out that in relationship to Indigenous cultural knowledges, GIS has been critiques for its limited potential or detrimental effects because it de-emphasized, ignores, or devalues concepts that are of central importance to Indigenous cultures, including the ubiquity of relatedness, the value of non-empirical experience, the need to control access to levels of geographical knowledge, and the value of ambiguity over binary thought. This workshop will go one step further than simply comparing the differences in cultural spatial knowledge and explore what kind of system could be based on Indigenous spatial realities, practices, and protocols and what would such a system look like? Not just looking at how indigenous knowledge differs from Western knowledge systems but at how one can actually structure a spatial information system that is based on indigenous conceptualizations.</Abstract>

<Abstract>EIA-0131835&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Guach, Susan&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;University of Kansas Center for Research Inc.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;BDEI: Biodiversity Information Organization using Taxonomy (BIOT)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Summary&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Biological resources are the basis of much of this Nations prosperity. The wise&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;stewardship of these riches affects current and future generations and, therefore, must be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;rooted in decisions based on the best information available. Because of the rapid growth&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of all content on the Internet, there is a corresponding increase in online biological&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information of all types. However, the sheer volume of data, and its widely varying&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;quality and physical distribution make it impossible for decision makers to make critical&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;decisions without the benefit of the existing body of information. This project aims to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;investigate and develop intelligent knowledge management tools and deploy them in this&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;important domain. In particular, we will investigate the use of a taxonomy as a reference&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ontology to provide a conceptual framework to allow intelligent agents to browse&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biodiversity information in a variety of formats widely distributed on the World Wide&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Web.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Our goals are four fold: 1) to investigate the use of a taxonomy as a reference ontology&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for browsing biodiverity information; 2) to evaluate techniques to automatically classify&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biodiversity information (web sites and individual web pages; 3) to personalize the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information presented to the users expertise and needs; and 4) lay the groundwork for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;larger, multidisciplinary, efforts in intelligent search, visualization, and personalization of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biodiversity information.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project proposes to build on existing work currently being done at the University of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Kansas related to information discovery, retrieval, and delivery, particularly the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;OBIWAN project for ontology based search, browsing and visualization of Web&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;resources and the PEET project for preserving and extending biodiversity information. A&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;partnership has already been established between the University of Kansas and the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) to capitalize on the knowledge,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;expertise, and tools that have grown out of the existing University of Kansas NSF&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;research agreement. As a result of this partnership, the first intelligent search agent for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biodiversity information, BioBot, has been developed.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is linking and integrating multi-media teaching materials (slides, videos and textbooks) used in Information Security courses based on a security ontology. The semantic linking of the multimedia course materials allows students to search and compose multimedia and interactive course materials based on the content, medium and learning styles, enabling flexible personalized learning. To achieve these goals, the project is focusing on several research tasks: (1) Segmenting and annotating learning media based on their learning content, (2) Building a Security ontology to be used for annotating and querying of the learning objects, (3) Adapting lecture content to student learning styles, and (4) Evaluating the usability and effectiveness of the linked multimedia security learning system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The technology and methodology that is being developed by this project, including the ontology builder for a given learning topic, the semantic segmentation of multimedia learning objects, the search, and personalization of learning objects, can be adapted to any course. The outcome of this project helps students build upon existing knowledge as they are being introduced to unfamiliar material, by creating subject specific searches of all course content. This changes the way students learn by making course content more organized, interactive, and instantly accessible while adding individualization options. Students are able to fill gaps in their previous learning instantly by integrating search results into their current studying. By having instant access to learning, and experiencing a truly interactive, individualized learning environment, students are less likely to be overwhelmed by course materials.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Project Abstract&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The objective of this research is to exploit the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) and to address the issues of interoperation and integration of engineering services. As reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the lack of information and service interoperability poses a major economic cost in both the manufacturing and the construction industries. With the proliferation of the Internet and advanced communication technologies, the exchange of information is essentially free and instantaneous. However, in order to support meaningful exchange of information among software applications and to bring them working together to solve complex, business problems, the software applications must be able to convey and understand the semantics among each other. Current developments of interoperability standards, although they do provide the means of communication among the tools within a narrowly defined domain, do not resolve the complex interoperability issues in a supply chain, which typically involves information and service integration across multiple disciplines. This research project aims to address this fundamental problem by developing (1) a formal, scalable knowledge composition approach to identify and resolve the semantic similarities and differences among the standards, thus allowing meaningful data exchange across disciplines; and (2) a software framework that can support integration of loosely coupled, distributed web-based services. Fundamental methodologies in information science and construction engineering will be developed to resolve the complex information issues that hinder effective information sharing among the participants in a supply chain and to develop a web-based service infrastructure that would enhance the integration of online applications. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Globalization is a major trend in the manufacturing and the construction industries. Effective and efficient supply chain management is vital to the global market and partnerships. The coordination and integration of the information flows within and across companies participating in the supply chain are critical to the success of any capital development projects. This research will have broad economic impact in manufacturing and construction, in that the tools developed in this research will enable information and software applications shared among the entire supply chain, independent of geographical locations, and throughout an entire project lifecycle development process. This research will contribute to new methodologies and innovative use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and to enhance the productivity in the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our civil infrastructure. To achieve the research objective, the investigators will collaborate closely with researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well as international scholars. The collaboration with NIST will help define future data and software standards for the construction and manufacturing industry. Working with international researchers will help dissemination and ensure usefulness of the research results globally. Last but not least, this research is an interdisciplinary effort between Computer Science and Engineering. This interdisciplinary effort will provide opportunities to educate future computer scientists and engineers to have better understanding of issues related to ICT and the engineering and construction industry.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The need for higher level processing of Life Sciences resources using a database-like system has increased in the post genomic era, as researchers move from sequence-based to whole genome-based analysis. High throughput and low-cost data processing and gathering techniques are helping researchers to publish an abundance of interesting data from across the globe at an exponential rate. Paradoxically, researchers are now faced with the problem of efficiently and effectively locating and using resources of interest from the vast amount of distributed data repositories. So, the need for generic system and tool support for higher level complex query processing, interpretation of data, and workflow management in a declarative fashion has become critical. The overall goal of this project is to develop a platform, which we will name LifeDB, for ad hoc integration of Life Sciences resources based on a declarative workflow query language called BioFlow. To a large extent, the system will support command line as well graphical interfaces for ad hoc application development and workflow query processing involving distributed resources without any need for traditional programming. The team is developing a visual interface, called WebFusion, for the automatic integration and workflow query processing using biological data as a manual and initial solution, a formal syntax and semantics for BioFlow, a declarative language, to support on the fly integration and workflow query and, new methods for low level data integration, wrapper, and schema mapping service requests toward the implementation of LifeDB system. The approach will change the way biologists currently query databases. Successful implementation and future enhancements of the system will obviate the need for biologists to focus on the &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; of their application and more on the &amp;quot;what to&amp;quot; of their research. Students are actively engaged throughout the research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of the Semantic Web is to free Web data from the applications that control them, so that data can be easily described and exchanged. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This is accomplished by supplementing natural language and other data found on the Web with machine readable metadata in statement form (e.g., X is-a person, X has-name Joe, X has-age 35) and enabling descriptions of data ontologies so that data from different applications can be integrated through ontology mapping. One element of this vision is to turn the Web into a giant database, against which one can issue structured queries and receive structured answers in response.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The SW-Store project is undertaking the clean-slate design of a DBMS specifically architected for this type of Web metadata and the prevalent Semantic Web data model, the Resource Description Framework, or RDF. The management of Semantic Web data presents many difficult challenges. The size of the data is growing rapidly, and in theory could reach the scale of the Web. The types of queries vary greatly in complexity, ranging from keyword search to complicated parameterized subgraph matching. Data integration, inference, and reasoning must be primitive operations that can operate at scale without human intervention. A data management system must not only be a place where data is stored and from which data is accessed; it must use the machine-readable semantics of the data to develop higher level models and help guide a user through the mass of information. In sum, a data management system for the Semantic Web will look very different from a standard, transactional, relational database system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The SW-store project researches the architecture of such a system. This research is inherently interdisciplinary, bringing in ideas from the data management, Semantic Web, and artificial intelligence communities. The project involves experimenting with partitioning schemes, where data is allocated to different nodes on a shared-nothing cluster so that queries can be run in parallel across multiple machines. It also involves exploring how ontology reasoning can be integrated inside the database system so that it can benefit from the near limitless scalability a shared-nothing cluster can offer. SW-Store further investigates providing iterative query interfaces and integrating complex queries with text search. Finally, the project involves studying the design of the storage layer for a Semantic Web data management system, looking at how data should be laid out, updates should be performed, and what materialized views to create.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Further information about the project can be found at the project Webpage: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://db.cs.yale.edu/swstore/</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The University of Arizona is awarded a grant to develop and evaluate a set of algorithms/software to help computers to read and ?understand? taxonomic descriptions of plants, animals, and other living or fossil organisms. The major functions of the algorithms/software include 1) annotate large sets of text descriptions in a machine-readable way to support various knowledge applications, including producing character matrices and identification keys for various taxon groups. The algorithms do not need large sets of training examples or hand-crafted regular expression or grammar rules; this makes the algorithms easy to use with different document types and/or subjects; 2) generate interactive identification keys for various taxon groups with minimal human intervention; 3) discover and verify the use of ontological concepts and relationships as represented in the descriptions to improve coverage and literary warrant of domain ontologies; and 4) produce high quality, reusability resources (e.g. lexicons, benchmarks, etc.) for future bioinformatics research. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impacts of this work include: support community-based informatics activities (e.g. ontology development, document annotation and retrieval); all software produced by the project will be made open source, along with documentation and training materials; reusable knowledge entities (glossaries, lexicons etc.) generated by the project will be conveniently accessible via Web services; annotated document collections will be accessible for research, education, and the public. In addition, Web-based education modules will be developed to spark interests of K-12 students in taxonomy and introduce them to scientific ways of collecting, observing, describing, and identifying ant specimens, and lastly, training opportunities and a mentoring program for graduate level students interested in digital information management will be created, using the software and document collections provided by the project.

<Abstract>Spatial thinking and reasoning is common to most knowledge domains. It is central to geography and other geosciences, and it is important in domains ranging from astronomy to zoology where geospatial databases are common. Other knowledge areas, such as dance, music, painting, sculpture, genetics, biology, physics, and linguistics, all require spatial thinking and use spatial metaphors. The peculiar contribution of spatial thinking and reasoning to solve certain types of problems has been recognized by psychologists like Beck and Uttal, who claimed that preparing and using spatial representations of information (as in maps, graphs, and images) provides a perspective that is not matched by any other means. The purpose of this research project is to develop a spatial task ontology and a concept lexicon to assist in the development of spatial thinking and reasoning. The investigator will define spatial thinking and identify sets of tasks that will help people understand the nature and importance of spatial thinking and reasoning in everyday life. The task ontology will identify different levels and types of tasks ranging from those designed to identify spatial primitives and will illustrate how such primitives can be expanded into discrete levels. The levels range from simple derivations to more complex multiple combinations of primitives and derivations to form complex concepts, such as geographic association and spatial interpolation. When elaborated, these concepts assist in the understanding of everyday activities, such as learning a route to primary school, choosing a neighborhood in which to live, or selecting places to work, shop, or enjoy recreational activities. This project aims to synthesize theoretical work on spatial ontology with empirical work on spatial task performance in the world of everyday experience. To achieve the project&amp;apos;s objectives, sets of innovative tasks will be developed and tested in both laboratory and field settings to evaluate whether or not developing an understanding of spatial concepts embedded in everyday living leads to enriched geographic understanding of neighborhood, city, region, nation, and the world.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will explore the ways that people organize the ways they think about space and the forms of thinking and reasoning that they use when they are confronted with spatial information. The research should shed light on how enhanced understanding of geographic concepts influences the comprehensive of spatial information, and it will illustrate differences that result from formal training in geographic concepts. All of these developments have intellectual implications ranging from the formalization of geographic knowledge to the development of more effective geographic information systems. This project will influence the development of future enhancements of geographic information systems, and it could help identify new strategies for more effective geographic education at all levels.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will investigate the phylogeny of green lacewings (Family Chrysopidae) using DNA sequences combined with external characteristics for all types of living and fossil species. Although there are a number of widespread, common species, the family includes at least 1200 species, many of which are poorly known and still undescribed and we lack a clear understanding of evolutionary patterns and processes in the group. The phylogeny will be used to explore how chrysopids evolved trash-carrying in larvae and how adults use chemicals from flowers and insect prey to attract mates. A vocabulary of descriptive morphological terms for lacewings will be defined, with terms related to each other and to those used for other insects, so that they have universal meaning when related back to gene expression. This effort will deliver products such as web-based identification tools and a monograph on world genera.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Green lacewings are used widely throughout the world in Integrative Pest Management in both field and horticultural cropping systems as generalist predators. Thus, the phylogenetic results from this project may lead to the discovery of new species that may also be of economic importance in agriculture. The findings will also enable greater understanding of lacewing evolution, including how and when certain behaviors and biology appeared. The project will contribute to the broader goal of developing a Common Arthropod Ontology, linking phenotype (i.e. appearance) to genotype (i.e. genetics) in all insect-like organisms. This project will also provide training for two community college interns, a PhD student, and a postdoctoral researcher.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will investigate the phylogeny of green lacewings (Family Chrysopidae) using DNA sequences combined with external characteristics for all types of living and fossil species. Although there are a number of widespread, common species, the family includes at least 1200 species, many of which are poorly known and still undescribed and we lack a clear understanding of evolutionary patterns and processes in the group. The phylogeny will be used to explore how chrysopids evolved trash-carrying in larvae and how adults use chemicals from flowers and insect prey to attract mates. A vocabulary of descriptive morphological terms for lacewings will be defined, with terms related to each other and to those used for other insects, so that they have universal meaning when related back to gene expression. This effort will deliver products such as web-based identification tools and a monograph on world genera.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Green lacewings are used widely throughout the world in Integrative Pest Management in both field and horticultural cropping systems as generalist predators. Thus, the phylogenetic results from this project may lead to the discovery of new species that may also be of economic importance in agriculture. The findings will also enable greater understanding of lacewing evolution, including how and when certain behaviors and biology appeared. The project will contribute to the broader goal of developing a Common Arthropod Ontology, linking phenotype (i.e. appearance) to genotype (i.e. genetics) in all insect-like organisms. This project will also provide training for two community college interns, a PhD student, and a postdoctoral researcher.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Both the metagenomics and the biodiversity communities face a major challenge: capturing detailed data on the environmental and the ecological context from which samples are drawn. Without these &amp;apos;metadata&amp;apos; (data about the primary, biological data), the value of the primary data is greatly diminished. To capture these different types of metadata, biologists/ecologists need tools that allow them to survey the literature in the relevant areas, identify the key concepts and vocabulary in the articles, and extract data and metadata into an appropriate representation for further processing, querying and exchange. The goal of this research is to create a proof-of-concept demonstration of interactive tools for the capture and curation of metadata, working in close collaboration with the metagenomics and biodiversity communities to understand their requirements. The text mining community has demonstrated significant progress: results from the recent BioCreative workshop (April 2007) show that text mining tools can identify mentions of key biological entities in running text and map these mentions to associated unique identifiers (e.g., Entrez Gene identifiers) at 80-90% accuracy. Much of this progress has been driven by a close association between curators of mature biological databases and the text mining community. Groups such as GOA, MINT, IntAct, Flybase, MGI, SGD, Wormbase have expert curators, a documented curation process, and they produce large quantities of expert curated data. These resources have provided good testbeds for evaluating new tools against human curated &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; test sets. The question now is how to apply this progress to create tools to support curators in an interactive process for extraction and mapping of critical information, such as gene/protein identifiers, geospatial information, or habitat information. These tools will support emerging communities, such as the metagenomics and biodiversity communities; they also can be put into the hands of both ontology builders to speed design of ontologies, and authors for capture of metadata at the source, rather than relying on post-publication expert curation. This work will have impact in four distinct areas: first, it will support the metagenomics and biodiversity communities, to speed capture of metadata; second, it will provide new challenges to the text mining community, to integrate tools into an interactive pipeline to support real curation activities; furthermore, such interactive tools can have major impact on the ability to create new ontologies and controlled vocabularies, through exploration of concepts in the literature; and finally, such tools can provide a prototype for author-driven annotation, to support capture and encode metadata at the source, as a kind of &amp;quot;automated spell-checker&amp;quot; for annotations.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Recent technical advances in large scale sequencing and genomics methods have triggered a scientific revolution with immense potential for extending biological knowledge. They have also posed an immense challenge: how to make optimal use of vast quantities of biological data. Without long-term high quality mechanisms for accessing and analyzing the data, the resources used in generating the data are in danger of going to waste. It is essential that databases to house the data, tools and interfaces to provide access to the data, and curatorial efforts to organize data for maximum utility be established and supported for the long term. For the model plant Arabidopsis, the successful effort to sequence the genome and the current effort of the 2010 Functional Genomics Initiative to understand the function of every Arabidopsis gene have produced great quantities of valuable data which can only be put to maximal use if the information is stored, interrelated, updated and made accessible to researchers for the long term. TAIR (the Arabidopsis Information Resource, www.arabidopsis.org) has taken up the challenge posed by this flood of data in its first five years of funding, developing a data structure to house the diversity of available data along with tools and interfaces needed to access and analyze it. The aim of the second phase of this project is to maintain the data and tools currently existing in TAIR and add new efforts in key areas, including maintaining and improving the genome annotation, extracting phenotype and gene expression data from the literature, and improving accessibility of TAIR&amp;apos;s resources to all biologists, teachers, students and the general public through development of tutorials and improved site navigation. TAIR will continue to develop controlled vocabularies and standardized data exchange mechanisms for maximal interoperability with other biological databases and will provide data in explicitly defined and structured formats to facilitate programmatic data retrieval. TAIR will also continue to play a central role within the 2010 Functional Genomics Initiative as the site where researchers can browse existing projects, view lists of genes already under investigation by other groups, and search for genes with no known function. TAIR will incorporate the resulting functional data and develop a tool that tracks progress toward the 2010 goal of complete functional annotation. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual merit: Transformation of large quantities of data into useful knowledge is one of the biggest problems in today&amp;apos;s post-sequencing era of biological research. Extraction of experimentally verified information from the corpus of research literature and encoding of the information using explicitly defined and computable ontologies representing biological concepts will facilitate the analysis and interpretation of large-scale data sets. In addition, creation and population of a data model for the complex relationships between biological objects will create a comprehensive computational framework for mining, exploring and retrieving the data. Development of standardized data curation methods also benefits the whole biological research community.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impact: The Internet is a widely accessed source of information for researchers and students. Creation of interactive, on-line tutorials and user guides for students, plant researchers with no or little Arabidopsis knowledge and Arabidopsis experts will provide educational materials that can be used in classrooms, laboratories, workshops and for self-paced learning. Dissemination of research methods and data through TAIR will benefit scientists all over the world and foster international collaboration. Continuous integration and annotation of data by TAIR&amp;apos;s curators will ensure that researchers have access to current, accurate data that would otherwise require significant time and effort to amass individually. Through collaborations with educators, college and pre-college students will access research materials to generate authentic data as they learn about scientific inquiry and plant biology, which will be disseminated to the research community through TAIR.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal seeks to obtain funding to acquire computing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;infrastructure to perform cross-disciplinary research in artificial&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;intelligence, natural language processing, bioinformatics, social&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;networks and related fields. In particular, the projects that will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;be supported by the infrastructure acquired include developing algorithms&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and architectures for large-scale ontology alignment, particularly in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the biomedical domain; mining Wikipedia and similar Web-based sources&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for geographical, temporal and ontological information; performing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;named entity recognition in biomedical and other domains; performing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;computational motivational and content analysis of socially generated&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;content such a blogs and micro-blogs; undertaking corpus-based computational&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;linguistics research in under-studied and possibly endangered languages from&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;India and other locations; developing better-performing algorithms for gene&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;expression analysis; and developing, implementing and comparing algorithms&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for protein structure prediction, particularly proteins that contain&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;coiled-coil structures. These projects deal with large amounts of data&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and information and processing such data and information requires large&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;amounts of computing power. Our proposal seeks to acquire adequate and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;flexible computing hardware to facilitate problem-solving in these and other&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;areas, so that current and future problems can be solved felicitously. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The infrastructure acquired will enable cutting-edge research by Ph.D.,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Masters and undergraduate students, including REU site students, in a&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;variety of cross-disciplinary topics that employ ideas and innovations&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in artificial intelligence, machine learning and information retrieval.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For example, the results of our research may enable creations of systems&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that discover overlaps and matches among large medical ontologies so that&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;painstakingly created domain-specific information can be fused, compared&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and utilized better; and may assist in creating programs that assist in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;automatically understanding and/or visualizing content of socially-generated&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Websites such as Wikipedia and Twitter.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~kalita.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Colorado State University is awarded a grant to develop machine learning methods for predicting protein function. The availability of protein function annotations supports the everyday work of biologists in multiple areas---from biomedical discovery to the study of plant drought resistance, and the design of bacteria useful in biofuel production. Assigning function to proteins in sequenced genomes is a major undertaking, and with new organisms being sequenced daily, experimentally determining the function of all the proteins in those organisms is not practical, requiring computational assignment of function to proteins that have not been studied in the lab. Computational scientists have been considering the problem of function prediction for over two decades. Yet, the basic methodology for protein function prediction has not changed much during this time and remains that of &amp;quot;annotation transfer&amp;quot; from proteins with a known function using a method for sequence comparison such as BLAST. Protein function prediction has several properties that make it difficult to apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to this problem, such as the large number of potential functions (thousands of possible terms), the fact that proteins can have multiple functions, and the hierarchical relationship between terms in the Gene Ontology (GO), which is the standard system of keywords used to describe protein function. In this work the problem of annotating proteins with GO terms will be explicitly modeled as a hierarchical classification problem using the methodology of &amp;quot;kernel methods for structured outputs&amp;quot;, which allows the modeling of complex prediction problems. This methodology will allow the PIs to integrate a variety of genomic information - sequence data, gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and information mined from the biological literature. The award will lead to a function prediction method with state-of-the-art accuracy. The project will have broad impact by providing the GOstruct method to the bioinformatics and biology communities in the form of downloadable software and an online-accessible function prediction server. Education will be impacted through the incorporation of the tool into new courses in programming for biologists and on kernel methods.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will create and maintain a current Body of Knowledge (BoK) in the relatively new, rapidly evolving, and multi-disciplinary field of Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIS&amp;amp;T). A new environment is needed that will enable the maintenance and expansion of the knowledge base of GIS&amp;amp;T in a dynamic, interactive, and collaborative fashion. The new environment also needs to provide for new ways to facilitate teaching, research, and professional advancement in GIS&amp;amp;T. Developing a common language in such a new, rapidly evolving, and multi-disciplinary field is critical to its future viability. This project creates a transformational, dynamic environment for pedagogy, knowledge building, discourse, collaboration, and research in GIS&amp;amp;T by leveraging persistent immersive synthetic environments, ontological analysis, and knowledge visualization approaches. This project has four key components. The first component provides an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing Body of Knowledge that was published in 2008, and develops a more comprehensive and inclusive organizing framework for the next version of BoK. Second, this project examines a hybrid methodology for generating ontology through top-down development and bottom-up knowledge discovery processes. Third, a visually centered and highly interactive representation of the GIS&amp;amp;T knowledge domain will be developed. This interactive representation will serve as a foundation upon which existing knowledge will be modified and new knowledge will be built. Finally, this project explores dynamic wikis and persistent immersive synthetic environments for their efficacy with respect to knowledge building, pedagogy and research to create viable active collaborative virtual communities.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Expected result of this research will be the construction of a solid foundation upon which to build and expand the existing knowledge domain of GIS&amp;amp;T in a new transformative environment which fosters learning, collaborative knowledge building, and research through the creation of functioning virtual communities of students, teachers, practitioners, industry, and researchers. This project will produce a build-out plan for the GIS&amp;amp;T knowledge domain, will develop viable methods to visualize, navigate and build an ontology of the field of GIS&amp;amp;T, will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the optimal virtual environments for the GIS&amp;amp;T knowledge domain. This project will create of a fundamental resource for both research and education within the field of GIS&amp;amp;T that will promote the advancement of the field and maintain the United States&amp;apos; lead in this critical component of our national economic and scientific base. The results of this project will provide a resource to link many of the GIS&amp;amp;T disciplines for grounding interdisciplinary activity.</Abstract>

<Abstract>How do young children form relationships in the context of transitions and change? In an attempt to answer this and several other related questions about human development and complex social processes, this study, implemented by a cross-disciplinary team consisting of an agent based modeler, several human developmentalists, and a mathematician, will examine the ontology and evolution of playgroups using an agent-based model (PlayMate) to simulate young children forming play partner preferences. In conjunction with the development of the agent based model, we will collect daily observations of 60 young children (ages 3-6) from three separate preschool classrooms over an academic year. Each child will be observed 75-125 times per month, allowing us to generate about 1500 - 3000 observations per month per classroom. These data will allow us to investigate the dynamic formation and evolution of playgroups, a micro-social phenomenon well suited for agent based modeling. In addition to observations of play activities, data will also be collected on child characteristics using teacher and observer ratings. These data will be used to determine the veridicality and validity of the simulation. This modeling approach provides us with the opportunity to establish this methodology as a prototype of how to simulate micro-social processes and compare the results against real data. By combining empirical data with theory, the findings of this study will contribute to building models of social influence that can be applied not only to children, but also to humans throughout the lifespan. Moreover, our interdisciplinary approach illustrates the potential richness of cross discipline work, and lays the foundation for training future scientists</Abstract>

<Abstract>There is at present no consensus among practitioners of modern systematics with regards to the nature of their object of study, and the same goes for those who are working to catalog biodiversity. The proposed project is an attempt to re-orient old debates on these topics by asking foundational questions in a new way while still paying attention to the philosophical, historical, and social implications of systematics and its applications.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project has two goals. The first is to examine and test some foundational ontological assumptions behind modern systematics and contemporary efforts to understand biodiversity. Once questions about units of analysis have been addressed, it will be possible to ask value, logistical, and policy questions in an informed way: How should we understand biodiversity? How is it best cataloged? Which species concepts work best in particular situations? Is there a unique best species concept? In what ways does it make sense for some or all of the various database projects to work together or to adopt the same ontology? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This work will proceed by way of two workshops. In the first, the PI will work with researchers at Arizona State University as well as with eminent species theorists from around the world to compare six of the most widely used approaches to species discovery using the same group (beetles of the genus Eleodes) and the same morphological, molecular, and combined data sets. The second workshop will bring together representatives from several biodiversity databasing projects to examine assumptions, compare units of analysis, and look for ways to work in concert. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project should shape the way each of the participant groups thinks about their units of study, and this has the potential for large-scale ramifications for everything from species definitions to project missions to database ontology and wider conceptions about what biodiversity is and what we should care about it.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this research project is to provide a framework model that integrates existing models of indoor and outdoor space, and to use this model to develop an interactive platform for navigation in mixed indoor and outdoor spaces. The user should feel the transition between inside and outside to be seamless, in terms of the navigational support provided. The approach consists of integration of indoors and outdoors on several levels: conceptual models (ontologies), formal system designs, data models, and human interaction. At the conceptual level, the project draws on existing ontologies as well as examining the &amp;quot;affordances&amp;quot; that the space provides. For example, an outside pedestrian walkway affords the same function as an inside corridor. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Formal models of place and connection are also used to precisely specify the design of the navigational support system. Behavioral experiments with human participants assess the validity of our framework for supporting human spatial learning and navigation in integrated indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments also enable the identification and extraction of the salient features of indoor and outdoor spaces for incorporation into the framework. Findings from the human studies will help validate the efficacy of our formal framework for supporting human spatial learning and navigation in such integrated environments. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Results will be distributed using the project Web site (www.spatial.maine.edu/IOspace) and will be incorporated into graduate level courses on human interaction with mobile devices, shared with public school teachers participating in the University of Maine?s NSF-funded RET (Research Experiences for Teachers). The research teams are working with two companies and one research center on technology transfer for building indoor-outdoor navigation tools with a wide range of applications, including those for the persons with disabilities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research objective of this award is to create a software framework based on ontology representation that facilitates data exchange between various product development software systems. The development of methods to enable ontology-based interoperability ensures that the semantics of product data are preserved, and when necessary translated. The main focus is on determining maps between concepts across different product development software while addressing issues of external heterogeneity (differences across systems), internal heterogeneity (heterogeneous components of product data) and uncertainty (one-to-many maps). An ontology will be developed to represent knowledge-based inputs, e.g., Function, Assembly and Tolerances using the W3C standards, OWL and SWRL. Concepts from information theory will be coupled with probabilistic approaches to determine semantic similarities using available data. Fuzzy-set based approaches will be applied to determine semantic similarities for concepts that cannot be compared using crisp probabilistic approaches. A semantic interoperability test bed will be developed to validate our techniques and those developed by other researchers in this area.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the results of this research will enable stakeholders in product development to express and exchange their intent instead of being restricted by the syntactic translators that lead to a loss of the intent. The use of W3C standards will facilitate the development of open-source software toolkits. The test bed will provide a suite of benchmarks, which can be used to evaluate competing techniques on a level playing field.. The ability to interoperate correctly will stimulate development of next-generation product development software. For small-business suppliers, this means that they can invest in just a few software tools that are the best for the nature of their job. This will enable engineers, managers, and technical professionals to be more effective, productive, and competitive.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Large-scale databases from sequencing projects, microarray studies, gene-function studies, protein-protein interactions, comparative genomics, structural biology, and so on are growing at rapid rates. These data come in diverse forms including expression data, network/interaction data, ontologies, text documents, and raw image/spectrum data. An integrated mining approach, combining these vast public repositories, is a crucial component in answering important scientific questions. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research is focusing on developing novel data mining techniques for integrated analysis and mining of complex gene/protein expression and interaction datasets taken from multiple sources. In particular, this research aims at: 1) Mining patterns of gene expression and regulation via Boolean expression and coherent cluster mining. 2) Mining novel protein interactions and network modules/motifs. 3) Integrated functional relationship mining over multiple genome-wide datasets. Given the proliferation of such complex, networked data in a variety of domains such as social networks, biological networks, semantic web, and so on, the methodology and algorithms being developed in this research will be widely applicable to other important areas.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award will create a LTER-Long-Term Ecological Research site in the coastal upwelling biome of the California Current System. The research will focus on mechanisms leading to temporal transitions between different states of the pelagic ecosystem. Observations from the CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) coastal ocean time series, currently in its 55th year, demonstrate the importance of external forcing of the pelagic ecosystem on multiple time scales, including: El Nino, the multi-decadal Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and a multi-decadal secular warming trend. Interactions of such forcing and biotic interactions can lead to nonlinear ecosystem responses that may be expressed as relatively abrupt transitions. The work will evaluate four hypothesized mechanisms for such ecosystem transitions:?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Sustained, anomalous alongshore advection of different assemblages; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-In situ food web changes in response to altered stratification and nutrient supply; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Changes in cross-shore transport and loss/retention of organisms; and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Altered predation pressure.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) LTER site will address these hypotheses with an integrated research program having three primary elements: (1) Experimental Process Studies will initially focus on the hypothesis of in situ food web changes. (2) Time Series Studies will evaluate alternative hypotheses using space-resolving time series measurements, including high frequency temporal measurements at different nearshore locations, satellite remote sensing, and an extensive quarterly measurement program at sea that will capitalize on and significantly enhance the CalCOFI time series. (3) Modeling and synthesis studies will help quantify the dynamics underlying the observations; provide a platform for hypothesis testing through numerical experiments and process models; provide a means for dynamic interpolation between observations in space and time; and help optimize the field program.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The proposed study region is an ideal location for an LTER site: it has 5 decades of climate context provided by CalCOFI; it is in a biogeographic boundary region, making it an early sentinel of climate change; it has pronounced spatial gradients in a relatively small geographic area; its anoxic basins provide a unique connection to paleoceanographic studies; and the extant 4-D physical ocean circulation model of the region will permit rapid advances in the development of coupled bio-physical models of ecosystem transitions. The site will allow the LTER network to compare coastal pelagic upwelling ecosystems with other biomes with respect to: Pattern and control of primary production, Spatial and temporal distribution of populations selected to represent trophic structures, Patterns of inorganic inputs and movements of nutrients, and Patterns and frequency of disturbances.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Broader Impacts: The project will have state of the art Information and Data Management to serve data internally, to LTER partners, educators, the general public, and policy makers. An active Education and Outreach program will team scientists with CA-COSEE and external partners to engage the K-12 community in both the process of and the understanding gained from this research. They will train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars across disciplinary boundaries. Through collaborations with informal science education organizations, they will reach hundreds of K-12 schoolchildren each year, including local low-income and minority students. Teachers and students will participate in field studies and gain training in oceanographic science. They will also assist in the development of new school curricula.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Research in search techniques was a critical component of the first generation of the Web, and has gone from academe to mainstream. A second generation &amp;quot;Semantic Web&amp;quot; is being built by adding semantic annotations that machines can understand and from which humans can benefit. Modeling, discovering and reasoning about complex relationships on the Semantic Web will enable this vision and transform the hunt for documents into a more automated analysis enabled by semantic technology. The beginnings of this shift from search to analysis can be observed in research and industry as users look beyond finding relevant documents based on keywords to finding actionable information leading to decision making and insights. Large scale semantic annotation of data (both domain-independent and domain-specific) is now possible because of an accumulation of advances in entity identification, automatic classification, taxonomy and ontology development, and metadata extraction. The next frontier, which fundamentally changes the way we acquire and use knowledge, is to automatically identify complex relationships between entities in this semantically annotated data. Instead of a search engine that returns documents containing terms of interest, there will be a system that returns actionable information (with the associated sources and supporting evidence) to a user or application. The user interacts with information universe through a hypothesis driven approach that combines search and inferencing, enabling more complex analysis and deeper insight. The research will focus on the design, prototyping and evaluation of a system, called SemDIS (Semantic Discovery) that supports indexing and querying of complex semantic relationships and is driven by notions of information trust and provenance and models of hypotheses and arguments under investigation. Such a capability greatly enhances the capacity of intelligence analysts to obtain (in time) information leading to a more secure homeland and world. Corresponding to the breadth and depth of the topics involved in the challenge undertaken, this is a collaborative project involving researchers at UGA&amp;apos;s LSDIS lab and UMBC. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;SemDIS will have broader impacts beyond the education and training of graduate students, and the publication of research findings. Results from the research will be integrated with courses, both existing and new. Institutional mechanisms in place will seek participation of students from underrepresented groups. The work will also gain from several academic-industry collaborations of the investigators. There will be an opportunity to leverage commercial infrastructure and raw metadata provided by Semagix. The researchers will collaborate with industry, and the students will be encouraged to intern at collaborating industrial labs. Within a broader social context, emerging knowledge-centric technologies raise legitimate privacy and civil liberties concerns. Building upon past policy making experience, the investigators will comment on potential implications of their scientific progress. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;More information can be found at http://http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/SemDIS/ and at http://www.cs.umbc.edu/SemDIS/</Abstract>

<Abstract>Access to the scientific literature has changed significantly due to the immediate availability of most new research over the World Wide Web. Taking advantage of this opportunity, new search engine tools have been developed such as Google Scholar and CiteSeer followed by CiteSeerX. CiteSeerX has become one the most comprehensive and widely-used online public resources for the CISE research community. The Semantic CiteSeerX project builds upon the work of CiteSeerX and will continue its original goal of research assistance. It will also provide more tools and features. Using the established CiteSeerX infrastructure, Semantic CiteSeerX extends and enhances this resource for community development. Semantic CiteSeerX will expand the CiteSeerX architecture to increase use, performance, reliability and applications while continuing to expand the breadth and depth of CiteSeerX&amp;apos;s collection. In addition new metadata such as algorithms, figures, tables and equations will be extracted and indexed and this data will be provided as an RDF resource. Personalized CiteSeerX search and author recommendations through an extension of MyCiteSeerX will be developed by useing individual search histories combined with exploiting patterns of citations and searches within the community. The impact of CiteSeerX and new features will be evaluated and methods will be explored to increase the availability of CiteSeerX as a community resource. As in the past all software will be released open source. For more information please see: http//citeseerx.ist.psu.edu</Abstract>

<Abstract>Life science data is valuable and hard to produce; it is important to share it in order to promote discovery. Effective database interoperability will facilitate the way life science data is accessed, retrieved, analyzed, and combined with other data. The original effort with focus on life science data, specifically databases concerned with four organisms, a plant, an animal, an insect and a simple eukaryote. General purpose databases of sequence and structure will also be integrated. The provision of methods for integrating proprietary data as well as public data will enable collaborations with industry. The system is based on a mediator-wrapper approach, which will be automated through wrapper induction, by using a domain ontology and independent source data models. The system will help overcome the scalability, maintenance and upgrade challenges in many life science databases.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Friction Stir Processing at the University of Missouri-Rolla, and the I/UCRC for E-Design at Virginia Polytechnic Institute have joined to do a collaborative research project designed to bring Friction Stir Process (FSP) to the design community. The project will provide a unifying tool to the product designer to synthesize solutions by bringing in discrete and distributed pieces of knowledge about function, form, shape, size, materials, manufacturing processes, tooling, life cycle cost, testing, and quality. The creation of the FSP case repository will be the first of its kind and it is anticipated to be very helpful for researchers and practitioners in the field that are considering using FSP.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project adresses the challenge of automatically extracting high-quality knowledge bases from text corpora. Previous work, led by Prof. Etzioni, developed KnowItAll (http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/knowitall), an unsupervised, domain-independent, scalable system that learns from the Web in an open-ended fashion. Another project, led by Prof. Domingos, has formalized and fully implemented a powerful framework called Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (see http://www.cs.washington.edu/ai/srl.html) that enable inference and learning in large, first-order models. This project integrates KnowItAll and MLNs to build large-scale ontologies from text corpora: extracting relational tuples, using joint inference to merge and validate the tuples, mapping extracted phrases to a taxonomy, and using probabilistic inference rules to answer queries about the ontology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Consider, for example, the query &amp;quot;how many Nobel Laureates where born in Europe?&amp;quot; In response, Google merely provides documents matching the keywords in the query. KnowItAll can only identify people who are explicitly identified as Nobel Laureates and Europeans. This project investigates a system that utilizes both information extraction and probabilistic reasoning to identify candidate answers, not explicitly stated in the text, and their likelihood of being correct. As a simple example, the system concludes that Einstein was born in Europe based on the sentence &amp;quot;Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany&amp;quot;. The query &amp;quot;what foods help prevent osteoporosis?&amp;quot; is answered using a multi-step reasoning chain regarding the ingredients of the food and their ability to prevent the disease.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact of this research includes novel methods of building knowledge bases automatically. Such knowledge bases (after some manual tuning, perhaps) could be used to support a wide range of applications from question-answering systems, to knowledge-based systems for medical applications, to background knowledge in support of machine reading of text. The knowledge bases created by this project will be made freely available to the research community as a Web-site and also as a Web-based API via the project Web site (http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/knowitall/ReadingTheWeb/).</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of Missouri-Columbia is awarded an early career development grant for Dr. Chi-Ren Shyu to develop new approaches to knowledge federation of visual phenotypes that can function and flourish in today&amp;apos;s landscape of diverse, constantly changing and inconsistent databases, schema, and terminology. The knowledge-sharing hub proposed in the project has the ability to use disparate computational resources to reliably exchange data and computations with little intervention from the user. A second challenge is to develop methods that answer the researchers&amp;apos; hybrid queries, which are combinations of scientific expertise and algorithms that detect and retrieve information related by image features, semantic description, map location, and patterns of DNA sequences, even when those data are not currently correlated with each other in the partner&amp;apos;s databases. The proposed hybrid query system will be the first and only in the research community that allows a researcher or an educator to submit an image of a mutant to the database and ask, &amp;quot;What genes or environmental factors cause this visual phenotype?&amp;quot; The [roject includes an educational component with two unique aspects: One focus is on training of undergraduate and graduate students and creating courses for them that are closely aligned with the research activities. The new courses, titled &amp;quot;Content Management in Bioinformatics,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Computer Vision and Image Understanding in Bioinformatics&amp;quot; will be pioneering courses in computational biology curriculum design. The other focus will leverage the proposed research activities to create, in conjunction with traditional computer science courseware, scientific data repositories for computation and biology education.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Intellectual merit: Transcription networks may be defined as the organization and relationships of elements that control the expression of functionally related genes. Previous studies have established the feasibility of characterizing the genetic regulation of gene expression based on full genome sequence and transcription profiling of families/pedigrees. However, few studies have attempted to describe transcription networks of genes and their regulators, much less to define the mechanisms of this regulation. This project represents the first level of information required to link genome and genotype to phenotype and, through this analysis, gain an understanding of the basis of morphological and developmental diversity of organisms. Describing these networks and their diversity also provides insight into the role of the regulation of gene expression in the evolution of higher plants. In this project, a comprehensive description of the genetic regulation of gene expression will be generated for the model perennial plant Populus trichocarpa. Transcription networks will be identified and genetic models for their control will be generated for different plant tissues, creating the first description of their ontogeny (developmental regulation within a given plant), diversity (number and complexity) and conservation both within the species and in comparison to other species. Candidates for the regulation of these transcription networks and the mechanisms of regulation will also be pursued. To achieve these objectives, whole-genome microarrays will be analyzed in combination with the P. trichocarpa genome sequence. Genetic loci that regulate gene transcript abundance variation (expression QTLs, or eQTL) will be identified. Gene expression networks will be defined based on coordinated regulation of functionally related genes and shared eQTLs. In addition to transcriptional regulatory circuits, these studies have the potential to provide information about post-transcriptional control, which has not been studied extensively in higher plants. The raw and processed microarray data, as well as the eQTLs and networks discovered through the research will be made available through a new web site (http://forestgenomics.ifas.ufl.edu/KirstLab/PoplarTranscriptionalNetworks). In addition, this information will be integrated with the genome sequence, genetic maps, and the Gene Ontology/Kegg functional annotation system that is available on the Poplar Genome Initiative Portal (www.jgi.doe.gov/poplar).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts: This project will provide training and support to four graduate students, and two postdoctoral associates, using innovative approaches that integrate quantitative genetics and genomics. It will also create opportunities for high-school students from underrepresented groups to participate in research at the University of Florida. For the plant scientific community, this research will establish a framework for comparisons with the architecture of transcript regulation in monocots, other dicots, and gymnosperms. The models of genetic regulation of individual genes and metabolic and regulatory networks will provide support for the analysis and modification of pathway products for improvement of phenotypes and metabolic engineering. The population that will be used in this study has also been extensively phenotyped for growth, plant architecture, wood quality and other valuable properties. This phenotypic information, in combination with the analysis of gene expression networks will be used to identify genes that regulate variation of commercially important traits for the agricultural and forestry industry. All the data will also be integrated with genome sequence, genetic maps, and the Gene Ontology / Kegg functional annotation based on a visual, searchable tool.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research will study ways to ease the production and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;use of high-performance matrix algebra software. Matrix algebra&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;calculations constitute the most time-consuming part of simulations&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in diverse fields, and lowering the runtimes of those computations&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;can have a significant impact on overall application performance. The&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;process of converting matrix algebra from algorithm to high-quality&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;implementation is, however, a complex one. At each step, the code&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;developer is confronted with a myriad of possibilities, many requiring&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;expertise in numerical computation, mathematical software, compilers,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and computer architecture. In response to these difficulties, the PIs&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;have developed a prototype taxonomy implementation entitled Lighthouse,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;which is a guide to the linear system solver routines from the software&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;package LAPACK. It is the first framework that combines a matrix algebra&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;software ontology with code generation and tuning capabilities. Its&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interface is designed for users across a spectrum of disciplines, career&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;levels, and programming experience.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PIs will dramatically extend the Lighthouse framework in a number of new directions. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;First, they will construct a general taxonomy of software that can be used to build&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;highly-optimized mathematical applications. The taxonomy will initially&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;provide an organized ontology of software components for high-performance&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;matrix algebra and later other numerical software from a variety of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;problem domains. It will serve as a guide to practitioners seeking&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to learn what is available for their mathematical programming tasks,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;how to use it, and how the various parts fit together. Second, the PIs&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;will apply a combination of source code analysis and machine learning&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques to fully automate the generation of parameterized models that,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;given representative inputs and a simple architecture description, can be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;evaluated to identify methods from various libraries that best reflect&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the user&amp;apos;s resource and performance requirements. This automation is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;critical for ensuring that the taxonomy is comprehensive enough to be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;useful and that it accurately reflects the features and performance&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of the latest versions of numerical libraries. Finally, the PIs will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;advance the state-of-the-art in tuning tools by improving some of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tools included in the taxonomy, broadening their ranges of functionality&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in terms of problem domains and languages. This project will produce&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the following impacts: greater performance by applications, enabling&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;both more discovery with available computing resources and greater&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;productivity of application programmers; greater understanding of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interaction between architecture and algorithms; and an educational tool&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for future computational scientists.</Abstract>

Within the software engineering domain, the goal is to reduce development times and produce higher quality code in enterprise software that is continually evolving due to changing business needs and management initiatives. This project builds upon and compliments tools and technologies developed over the past decade such as: Services Oriented Architecture (SOA), Model Driven Architecture (MDA), and associated standards (primarily from the Extensible Markup Language (XML), web services, Unified Modeling Language (UML), and Object Management Group (OMG) communities). The SOA and MDA paradigms focus primarily on procedural representations of business processes and BPI environments. The premise of this research is that value can be added to BPI by developing a targeted declarative framework for specifying the properties of business processes and associated artifacts, including their possible behaviors and possible impacts on their environment. Two improvements that this declarative approach may produce are: (1) precision, because in many cases the procedural specifications, especially when at a higher level of abstraction, are ambiguous in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, and (2) flexibility, because it will afford many more kinds of incomplete specification than available from the procedural approaches. The foundation of the declarative framework for BPI is provided by the Process Specification Language (PSL), a first-order logic based ISO standard developed for specifying, analyzing, and integrating processes, initially introduced manufacturing. The domain of knowledge that supports this project is, to a large extent, the result of prior research by project team members including the design and development of PSL. All four research collaborators played a central role in the development of the Firstorder Logic Ontology for Web Services (FLOWS), which forms part of the Semantic Web Services Framework (SWSF). FLOWS is a formal extension of PSL, which explicitly incorporates and axiomatizes in a declarative framework the key building blocks of semantic web services. FLOWS (and PSL beneath it) provide a starting point for the development of a declarative framework for supporting BPI design. By targeting on the design and management of business processes with the service-oriented paradigm, this project may improve the efficiency and productivity of business process management and integration and lay a foundation for SOA research as a step towards service science. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Program Manager: Anita J.

<Abstract>Collaborative grants have been awarded to the University of Maryland, the University of Iowa and St. Bonaventure University to develop a methodology that exploits the wealth of annotation knowledge, notably Gene Ontology (GO) and Plant Ontology (PO) annotations of Arabidopsis genes. Motivated by the availability of rich and as yet insufficiently tapped collections of gene annotations, the project aims to facilitate the discovery of hidden knowledge that could be the basis of further scientific research. The methodology will extract patterns of interest from annotation graphs (pattern discovery). Literature-based methods will extract sentences that validate the biological meaning underlying these patterns (pattern validation). To demonstrate the methodology, the PattArAn tool (Patterns in Arabidopsis Annotations) will be customized for Arabidopsis. PattArAn will provide the user with a graphical presentation of patterns of Arabidopsis genes and associated GO and PO CV terms. Graph data mining techniques and efficient algorithmic solutions to identify dense subgraphs (DSG) and to perform graph summarization (GS) will be developed. Algorithms to mine the literature for relevant sentences for an extracted pattern (referred to as the imprint) will be developed. PattArAn will enable iterative exploration and will incorporate allied steps such as consulting gene function prediction. The project will involve collaboration with biologists for building and refining annotation graphs, and validating patterns to ensure relevance to their research.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project makes broad contributions to the Arabidopsis thaliana community. PattArAn may assist Arabidopsis curators to manage GO-PO annotations and complement existing tools such as Textpresso and AraNet. It can also be used to bootstrap an annotation database for other plant species given that their genome sequence information is available. The project offers significant research and educational experiences for graduate students (University of Maryland and Iowa) and undergraduate students (St. Bonaventure University). Team members will continue to mentor women and students from under-represented communities, participate in outreach activities, lead a Journal Club, etc. The outcomes from this research project will be disseminated via biology and bioinformatics venues.

<Abstract>This project is built on the interdisciplinary collaboration between multimedia and natural language processing (NLP) researchers. The goal of this exploratory research is to provide effective methods for organizing, searching, mining and reasoning with web-scale multimedia. The approach is based on formulation of a structured multimedia database, called Multimedia Information Networks (MINets) which enables new searching and mining paradigms such as keyword query of unlabeled image/video databases, query expansion in content-based image retrieval (CBIR), and measuring similarity between different modalities such as an image and a piece of text). In addition, MINets framework is expected to provide the ability to perform robust inference (e.g., recognizing objects and activities in images or videos) in the presence of noise and uncertainty. In its simplest form, a MINet is a graph where nodes are either concepts (text) or data (such as images), and links are ontological/semantic relationships between concepts, attachment of images to concepts, and visual similarity measures between images. Construction of an experimental MINets framework involves crawling the Web for a particular domain, gathering images with associated text and exploiting natural language processing, computer vision and mining techniques in establishing the concepts, associated images, interconnecting links and an ontology that supports inference. Validation against current web search engines and CBIR techniques is expected to provide a proof-of-concept for the novel MINets framework.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This interdisciplinary exploratory project is expected to yield general theoretical and algorithmic MINets framework that will provide new searching, mining and reasoning capabilities for multimedia data. It will help to define new research areas in effective utilization of multimedia information sources for cross-media and cross-conceptual knowledge discovery and analysis, large-scale annotation, information fusion and inference. Project results, including open source software, annotated corpora, scoring metrics will be disseminated via project Website (https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/qi4/www/MINets.htm). This project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the issue that enterprises today are faced with the problem of linking their disparate structured databases with unstructured text documents like articles, manuals, reports, emails, blogs, folksonomies, and others. There is no easy way to perform a federated search, let alone enable more intelligent applications over such diverse data sources without considerable time and effort spent in system and data model customization by experts. With the recent emergence of commercial grade Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple stores it becomes possible to merge massive amounts of structured and unstructured data by defining a common ontology model for the DBMS schemas and representing the structured content as semantic triples. Lymba proposes novel methods to transform unstructured data sources inside corporate firewalls into a consolidated RDF store, merge it with other ontologies and structured data, and moreover offer a natural language question answering (QA) interface for easy use. To make the QA robust, an innovative hybrid approach is proposed that draws answers from the RDF store as well as directly from indexed text documents. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The potential impact of delivering a question answering system that operates on a commercial grade RDF store is significant as it fills a need for users of this store to easily access more information and quickly implement intelligent applications using natural language questions as the main vehicle. The proposal also leads to enabling technology software to advance the semantic web. If successfully deployed, the proposed research has the potential to translate into a viable commercial product with significant revenues.</Abstract>

The project will involve collaboration with biologists for building and refining annotation graphs, and validating patterns to ensure relevance to their research.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project makes broad contributions to the Arabidopsis thaliana community. PattArAn may assist Arabidopsis curators to manage GO-PO annotations and complement existing tools such as Textpresso and AraNet. It can also be used to bootstrap an annotation database for other plant species given that their genome sequence information is available. The project offers significant research and educational experiences for graduate students (University of Maryland and Iowa) and undergraduate students (St. Bonaventure University). Team members will continue to mentor women and students from under-represented communities, participate in outreach activities, lead a Journal Club, etc. The outcomes from this research project will be disseminated via biology and bioinformatics venues.

<Abstract>Daniel Richter &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;EAR-0533557&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This award will initiate a cyberinfrastructure to promote interdisciplinary research investigating the zone defined by the outer limits of vegetation and the lower boundary of ground water, identified by the National Research Council as the Critical Zone. A complex interplay of physical, chemical, and biological reactions controls processes within this Critical Zone and has become the focus of research among a community of scientists derived from ecology, soil science, biology, geochemistry, hydrology, and geomorphology. An interdisciplinary team of scientists from these disciplines created the Weathering System Science Consortium (WSSC) in 2003 specifically to advance study of the Critical Zone. In an NSF-sponsored meeting in 2005, this consortium proposed a program the Critical Zone Exploration Network (CZEN) to study four broad research questions targeting the Critical Zone. CZEN is envisioned as a network of sites, people, tools, and ideas, which will investigate the response of the Critical Zone to global change, will promote systematic data and sample collection, will provide databases and sample storage facilities, and will train the next generation of Critical Zone scientists. The CZEN cyberinfrastructure must meet the needs of scientists from an array of disciplines and institutions. Many of these disciplines have their own conceptualizations, nomenclature, and methodologies for weathering processes. This research project will develop an integrative language (an ontology) for Critical Zone Science that will serve to bridge discipline boundaries. Building this ontology through a community-based effort will not only produce a focused, highly integrative communication standard for advancing the science of the Critical Zone, it will foster new collaboration and partnerships among groups that have not traditionally interacted. The development of this cyberinfrastructure will centralize Critical Zone data and metadata and increase usefulness of Critical Zone studies. A web-based knowledge-management environment to facilitate collaboration and sharing of data collected world-wide will be created to meet these goals. This project will contribute directly to the developing CZEN initiative by fostering interaction among the wide range of scientists and scientific disciplines that study the earths Critical Zone.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Information systems for supporting the fluid organizations of the 21st century must be correspondingly open and agile, able to automatically configure themselves out of heterogeneous system components, accommodate the dynamic exit and entry of hitherto unknown participants and maintain system stability in the face of limited trust. The goal of this project is to develop technologies that enable the construction of such Contractual Agent Societies (CAS), open information systems where independently developed agents configure themselves automatically through a set of dynamically negotiated social contracts. Social contracts define the shared context of agent interactions, including ontologies, joint beliefs, joint goals, normative behaviors, etc. In addition, they specify classes of contract violations together with associated sanctions and enforcement mechanisms. The deliverables of this work include a language and ontology for representing social contracts, as well as the definition of agent architectures capable of negotiating social contracts and adapting their behavior accordingly. Significant attention will be given to the experimental evaluation of the proposed agent architecture by developing prototype CAS versions of at least two different electronic marketplaces and demonstrating how CAS buyer and seller agents can successfully move between marketplaces, adapting themselves according to the rules of each marketplace.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project seeks to improve educational assessment rubrics. Accreditation requires adequate assessment rubrics to substantiate expected student outcomes. Faculty struggle with specifying outcomes and their rubrics, due to inexperience and lack of proper tools. Our first research objective is to accumulate and classify expected outcomes, including common assessment techniques, e.g. survey, portfolio, and projects, and associated rubrics to evaluate if expectations are exceeded, met, or not met. Classification leads to the second objective defining a many-to-many mapping of outcomes to rubrics. The third objective initiates controlled customization of outcomes, rubrics, and mappings for better evaluation coverage and to satisfy accreditation goals for continuous assessment improvement. The proposed effort defines SALR (Spiral Assessment Loop for Rubrics), based on the spiral model for software engineering, to generate, test, and evaluate assessment rubrics. SALR uses the resulting outcome classification ontology from which the mapping of outcomes to rubrics emerges coupled with current evaluations of achievement to determine needed changes. The anticipated results are documented classification of outcomes, assessment techniques and rubrics for computer science and some broader engineering sciences, ontologically based mappings of outcomes to rubrics, and spiral assessment loop prototype for commercial development.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Universities can benefit from software-based rubrics development and evaluation scaled to the collegiate level. Curriculum-based rubrics immediately inform faculty of assessment issues and needed improvements. Commercial software can provide quick and easy storage, retrieval, and evaluation performed on a semester, exam, or project basis. Students are well-served by achieving success in critical education aspects. With performance-based rubrics at hand, students can understand expectations and how to reach them. Without explicit expectations, all may be surprised at failed outcomes. Unfortunately, few in higher education know how to construct proper rubrics. Current tools do not scale to university levels. Thus, rubrics must often be tailored or created from scratch. Thus, this research and development effort can remove barriers to assessment, benefiting faculty and student understanding of successful outcomes.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Scholars from a range of disciplines long have sought to understand relationships between visual representations and linguistic categories of landscape elements. One line of inquiry has sought to address the question: Do speakers of different languages think in different concepts, or is thinking more nearly universal and language more superficial? This collaborative research project will investigate how people conceptualize the natural landscape and how they relate to it. The project will investigate landscape terminology used by some indigenous communities living in arid landscapes. Language will be a major focus of the research. The project will study both the generic terms that the people use to refer to elements of the landscape and also the ways that the people describe the landscape in their traditional narratives. The research will examine how members of three cultural and linguistic groups subdivide, classify, and talk about their landscapes. The three groups are the Navajo (Dine) of northern Arizona and New Mexico, the Hopi of northern Arizona, and the Yindjibarndi of the northwestern part of Western Australia. Project researchers will conduct in-depth interviews with expert consultants within the three communities regarding the vocabulary for referring to landforms, water bodies, and other geographic features. Researchers will express the definitions within a formal ontology of the landscape and will confirm the definitions and term lists by compiling pictorial dictionaries. The researchers and consultants also will recruit young members of these indigenous communities to take photographs of significant aspects of the landscape, discuss the content of these photographs with elders, and report results. Photographs of these landscapes also will be shown to English-speaking undergraduate subjects to provide baseline interpretations for English language terminology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will investigate the degree to which the apparent structure of the landscape depends upon the raw facts of physical reality, how much of the structure arises due to the nature of human perception and other aspects of cognition, and how much of the structure is determined by culture, language, and lifestyle. These are fundamental issues in the behavioral and cognitive sciences for all knowledge domains, yet they hardly have been address with respect to the landscape. The research seeks to understand the close yet different interconnections among culture, history, spirituality, and landscape for each of the cultural groups. One goal of the research is to characterize these peoples&amp;apos; landscape categories and terminology with sufficient precision and rigor to allow geographic information systems (GIS) to detect, manipulate, and reason about the categories and the entities belonging to them. Some of the tribes, including the Navajo and Hopi, currently are using commercial GIS to manage tribal lands, but it appears that the software cannot readily incorporate traditional knowledge and integrate such knowledge with technoscience data from government sources. Lessons learned in this project will guide future work on cross-cultural interoperability of geographic information systems and will contribute to the design of databases and GISs that can be used by speakers of different natural languages both within their communities and for joint management of lands and landscapes. Pictorial dictionaries of landscape terminology also will provide the tribes and cultures in question with material that may contribute to cultural preservation through use in the schools and other outlets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Information is one of the biggest assets for most enterprises. In today&amp;apos;s information age, almost every enterprise decision is based on a detailed analysis of data recorded in diverse sources ranging from structured databases to the World Wide Web. To ensure that data retrieved from different sources is used appropriately and within context, it is imperative that the provenance of the data be recorded and made available to its users. Provenance refers to the knowledge that enables a piece of data be interpreted correctly. It is the essential&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ingredient that ensures that users of data (for whom the data may or may not have been originally intended) understand the background of the data. This includes elements such as, who (person) or what (process) created the data, where it came from, how it was transformed, the assumptions made in generating it, and the processes used to modify it. This research team will investigate the semantics of data provenance and will develop an ontology to represent the semantics of data provenance, including the development of ways to automate the capture of provenance. Using new product design and development as the real world domain, a partnership will be formed with a large defense contracting company, viz., Raytheon Missile Systems, located in Tucson, Arizona, to investigate these research issues. A testbed will be created to capture and use provenance and evaluate the system&amp;apos;s utility using a well defined set of metrics. Raytheon has committed considerable resources in the form of personnel and access to software as needed for this research.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the theoretical framework for understanding and representing the semantics of data provenance. This is considerably different from existing work on provenance which has mainly explored the &amp;apos;where&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;why&amp;apos; of provenance. This work will pave the way for understanding the extent to which provenance can be automatically captured.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project has the potential for broader impacts on society. Most importantly, the development of techniques to represent, capture and deploy provenance has the potential to revolutionize the Department of Defense product development industry and other domains as well. The ultimate goal is to enable the development of autonomic and interoperable enterprise data management systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This is a research project in the foundations of quantum mechanics that focuses on the concept of spontaneous collapse of the wave function, and more specifically on a specific theory that characterizes the collapse that was first put forward by Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber (GRW) in 1986. Although Quantum mechanics underlies most of modern physics, it is beset with foundational problems; it is very successful in predicting observable phenomena, ye it does not actually say what kind of microscopic events and mechanisms lead to these phenomena. Theories that attempt to complement quantum mechanics and close this gap are called &amp;quot;quantum theories without observers.&amp;quot; They do so by replacing Schroedinger&amp;apos;s equation by a stochastic time-evolution law for the wave function that implements the concept of collapse of the wave function in a precise way; more to the point, it also implies that macroscopic superpositions such as Schroedinger&amp;apos;s cat quickly decay, while the Schroedinger equation remains an excellent approximation for any system comprising only a small number of particles.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is an investigation into philosophical aspects of the GRW theory. The first goal, on which the PI and a graduate student will work together, is to mathematically prove statements like the following: It is impossible for inhabitants of a GRW universe to measure the number of collapses that occur in a given system in a given time interval, although, according to the GRW theory, this is a well-defined number. More generally, the statements studied describe limitations to what inhabitants can know about their world. The researchers in this project do epistemology by means of mathematical proofs. Another goal, on which the PI will work with collaborators from physics and philosophy, is to explore and explain the philosophical framework of the GRW theory, in particular in the light of a recent technical development in which the PI was involved: the derivation of an operator formalism, analogous but not identical to the operator formalism of quantum mechanics, encoding the empirical predictions of the GRW theory including small deviations from standard quantum mechanics. The topics to be discussed include the need for a precise ontology in space and time (such as the flash ontology) and the idealizations involved in both operator formalisms.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will expand and continue the operations of Gramene, a comparative mapping database for rice and other cereals. Gramene is a public resource that leverages the rice genomic sequence to allow researchers working on maize, wheat, sorghum and other cereals to apply knowledge derived from the study of the rice genome to the synteneic regions in their species of interest. We use controlled vocabularies (ontologies) to describe rice genes, mutants and varieties, high throughput analytic techniques to annotate features on the genome, and a combination of automatic and manual annotation to discover relationships between genetic and physical maps. All raw and processed data as well as software, is available on the Gramene web site for unrestricted use.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Our specific aims are to:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. Map between the rice and maize genomes.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Develop an open source genome annotation pipeline.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3. Develop tools to manage natural variation in cereal varieties.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;4. Acquire and maintain quantitative trait loci associations in rice.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;5. Undertake a pilot project to annotate maize mutants with the Plant Ontology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;6. Add advanced query tool and report functionality to the Gramene web site.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;7. Undertake community outreach to high school students.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact of this project will be to improve the understanding of cereal biology. Rice, maize and wheat are the three most important crops in the world, and improving their yield and stability while decreasing their environmental impact are key to improving world food and environmental security. Due to the shared ancestry of these three crops, it is possible to apply results from one of these species to another. However, to make this cross-species translation possible it is critical that the thousands of researchers working in each of these species can effectively communicate their discoveries across species and community boundaries. The continued development of Gramene will help integrate the genomics investment across the grasses, which will allow genomics researchers to communicate their results effectively. Finally, it will also start providing the informatics infrastructure needed to help bridge the gap between genomics and applied plant improvement.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Project Abstract&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;SES 0327550&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Gordon Kane, University of Michigan&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Forces/Interactions and Fields: Toward a Metaphysics of the Actual World&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Metaphysical debates often proceed with little attention to contemporary scientific concepts, hypotheses and methodology. The co-PI&amp;apos;s past research into physicalism and emergentism shows that philosophers cannot always afford this neglect, for viably formulating these metaphysical theses requires appeal, first, to the notion of a fundamental force or interaction; and second, (insofar as fundamental forces/interactions are standardly taken to be systems of interacting fields) to the notion of a field. More generally, our best-confirmed scientific theories are field theories; yet with few exceptions (including Sunny Auyang, Tian Cao, and Paul Teller) philosophers have not engaged the task of working out the presuppositions and entailments of a field metaphysics, and metaphysical debates commonly presuppose the sort of atomistic metaphysics associated with Democritus and Hume.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This proposal aims to give the co-PI the scientific understanding necessary to help correct this neglect. The first component consists in studying advanced physics at the University of Michigan, under the committed guidance of Gordon Kane, an eminent physicist working on super-symmetric extensions of quantum field theory. The course of study will consist in auditing several graduate courses in modern physics, supplemented by directed study of additional texts on gauge theories and quantum field theory, coupled with weekly meetings with Kane addressing the technical and conceptual foundations of contemporary physics.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The second component of the proposal consists in applying physics training to projects in fundamental ontology (especially as pertaining to a field metaphysics), and disseminating the results in metaphysics and philosophy of science journals. Relevant papers include &amp;quot;The Particular Nature of the Quantum Field&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Reality of Non-field Particulars on a Field Metaphysics&amp;quot;. More broadly, the co-PI will explore the impact of the concepts of force/interaction and field on metaphysical debates concerning causality, laws and modality. Since these debates tend to proceed under the atomistic principle that there are no necessary (ontological or causal) connections in nature (which principle is undermined from the perspective of a scientifically-informed field metaphysics), the proposed research is of considerable potential impact. The proposal also strikes a triple-blow for gender equality in three of the most male-dominated areas of the academy: physics, foundational metaphysics, and philosophy of physics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research will develop a flexible data query and analysis system based on the web services paradigm. As an application domain several goods movement planning problems will be examined along with their effects on spatial urban structure. The research has three objectives: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) to advance computer science research by developing an expressive web services description language and techniques for dynamically&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;composing web services, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) to develop and conduct test applications of an intra-metropolitan goods movement flow model using web services in cooperation with government partners, and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) to use the model to conduct social science research on intra-metropolitan economic linkages and spatial structure. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Although the focus is on the specific topic of urban goods movement, the approach to web service composition is general and can be applied to other scientific data gathering and analysis tasks. The first objective is to develop Argos, a general framework for dynamically composing web services. Many scientific problems can be modeled as a workflow that includes information gathering and processing operations. Argos will provide graphical tools for manual specification and composition of web services, as well as automatic composition based on expressive web service descriptions for given application domains (such as transportation planning). The second objective is to use Argos in an actual metropolitan planning application. In consultation with an advisory team of government representatives, from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the San Bernardino Associated Governments, the Southern California Association of Governments and the Port of Long Beach. a scenario analysis using the Los Angeles region as a case study will be conducted. The scenario analysis will allow evaluation of Argos both in terms of its utility as a transportation planning tool as well as its ease of use by practitioners. The third objective is to extend the transportation planning domain to address problems of urban spatial structure that heretofore have not been practical for social science researchers to study due to the lack of tools for integrating and analyzing available data. There is an extensive theoretical literature on employment location; transport of freight inputs and outputs are critical elements of these models. Empirical research on employment location is limited, because of the lack of availability of freight flow data. The research team will analyze the relationships between industry mix, flows, and urban spatial structure, using the Los Angeles region as a case study.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research will study ways to ease the production and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;use of high-performance matrix algebra software. Matrix algebra&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;calculations constitute the most time-consuming part of simulations&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in diverse fields, and lowering the runtimes of those computations&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;can have a significant impact on overall application performance. The&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;process of converting matrix algebra from algorithm to high-quality&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;implementation is, however, a complex one. At each step, the code&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;developer is confronted with a myriad of possibilities, many requiring&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;expertise in numerical computation, mathematical software, compilers,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and computer architecture. In response to these difficulties, the PIs&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;have developed a prototype taxonomy implementation entitled Lighthouse,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;which is a guide to the linear system solver routines from the software&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;package LAPACK. It is the first framework that combines a matrix algebra&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;software ontology with code generation and tuning capabilities. Its&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interface is designed for users across a spectrum of disciplines, career&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;levels, and programming experience.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PIs will dramatically extend the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Lighthouse framework in a number of new directions. First, they will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;construct a general taxonomy of software that can be used to build&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;highly-optimized mathematical applications. The taxonomy will initially&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;provide an organized ontology of software components for high-performance&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;matrix algebra and later other numerical software from a variety of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;problem domains. It will serve as a guide to practitioners seeking&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to learn what is available for their mathematical programming tasks,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;how to use it, and how the various parts fit together. Second, the PIs&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;will apply a combination of source code analysis and machine learning&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques to fully automate the generation of parameterized models that,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;given representative inputs and a simple architecture description, can be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;evaluated to identify methods from various libraries that best reflect&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the user&amp;apos;s resource and performance requirements. This automation is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;critical for ensuring that the taxonomy is comprehensive enough to be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;useful and that it accurately reflects the features and performance&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of the latest versions of numerical libraries. Finally, the PIs will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;advance the state-of-the-art in tuning tools by improving some of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tools included in the taxonomy, broadening their ranges of functionality&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in terms of problem domains and languages. This project will produce&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the following impacts: greater performance by applications, enabling&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;both more discovery with available computing resources and greater&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;productivity of application programmers; greater understanding of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interaction between architecture and algorithms; and an educational tool&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for future computational scientists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Collaborative grants have been awarded to the University of Maryland, the University of Iowa and St. Bonaventure University to develop a methodology that exploits the wealth of annotation knowledge, notably Gene Ontology (GO) and Plant Ontology (PO) annotations of Arabidopsis genes. Motivated by the availability of rich and as yet insufficiently tapped collections of gene annotations, the project aims to facilitate the discovery of hidden knowledge that could be the basis of further scientific research. The methodology will extract patterns of interest from annotation graphs (pattern discovery). Literature-based methods will extract sentences that validate the biological meaning underlying these patterns (pattern validation). To demonstrate the methodology, the PattArAn tool (Patterns in Arabidopsis Annotations) will be customized for Arabidopsis. PattArAn will provide the user with a graphical presentation of patterns of Arabidopsis genes and associated GO and PO CV terms. Graph data mining techniques and efficient algorithmic solutions to identify dense subgraphs (DSG) and to perform graph summarization (GS) will be developed. Algorithms to mine the literature for relevant sentences for an extracted pattern (referred to as the imprint) will be developed. PattArAn will enable iterative exploration and will incorporate allied steps such as consulting gene function prediction. The project will involve collaboration with biologists for building and refining annotation graphs, and validating patterns to ensure relevance to their research.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project makes broad contributions to the Arabidopsis thaliana community. PattArAn may assist Arabidopsis curators to manage GO-PO annotations and complement existing tools such as Textpresso and AraNet. It can also be used to bootstrap an annotation database for other plant species given that their genome sequence information is available. The project offers significant research and educational experiences for graduate students (University of Maryland and Iowa) and undergraduate students (St. Bonaventure University). Team members will continue to mentor women and students from under-represented communities, participate in outreach activities, lead a Journal Club, etc. The outcomes from this research project will be disseminated via biology and bioinformatics venues.

<Abstract>Georgetown University is awarded a grant to conduct a series of BioCreative Challenge Evaluations and Biocuration Workshops to address the current barriers in using text mining tools in the biology domain. Specifically, three workshops will be organized to bring together the biological research community and developers of text mining tools for user requirement analysis, user-based evaluations and standard development for tool integration. The specific aims of the workshops are to: (i) define requirements and evaluation criteria that will maximize utilization of text mining tools by the broad biological user community; (ii) provide both system- and user-based evaluations, with metrics that measure precision and recall (system-based), as well as the effect of text mining on biocuration and knowledge discovery such as throughput and quality (user-based); and (iii) adopt, develop and recommend community standards to improve interoperability of text mining tools for data exchange and tool integration. The outcome will be to bridge the gap in linking literature to knowledge by focusing on biological use cases for database curation and knowledge discovery. The deliverables from the workshops will consist of: (i) text mining tools, including interactive and/or integrated text mining systems, that are benchmarked and evaluated by BioCreative, (ii) literature corpora used in the BioCreative evaluations, and (iii) scientific publications from these workshops in special issues of high impact journals containing results, evaluations and critical articles, including recommendations for community standards for text mining. Georgetown will collaborate with the Mitre Corporation in carrying out this workshop series.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The workshops will connect the text mining and biological communities to develop common standards and user requirements, with broad impact beyond the specific text mining applications in this project. The project will provide interdisciplinary research experience for students and researchers involved in the project or participate in the workshops. The project will provide a research and educational infrastructure for broad areas of biology, allowing text mining systems to become an enabling infrastructure for biocuration and knowledge discovery.

<Abstract>This award is made using funds made available by the American Recovery &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Project will implement configurable and extensible semantic eScience framework. Con&amp;amp;#64257;guration will require some research into accommodating different levels of semantic expressivity and user requirements from use cases. Extensibility is best achieved in a modular approach to the semantic encodings (i.e. ontologies) performed in a community setting, i.e. an ontology framework into which specific applications all the way up to communities can extend the semantics for their needs. Over the past few years, semantic technologies have evolved and new tools are appearing. Part of the effort in this pro ject will be to accommodate these advances in the new framework and lay out a sustainable software path for the (certain) technical advances. In addition to a generalization of the current data science interface, project will include an upper-level interface suitable for use by clearinghouses, and/or educational portals, digital libraries, and other disciplines.</Abstract>

Such a capability is critically important to allow rapid configuration of computing systems that support extended enterprise collaboration. The application domain is the flexible production network. Flexible production networks (FPNs) consist of firms that operate in a project oriented, customized production environment. Most construction (totaling approximately 8% of GNP) and growing parts of manufacturing industry operate in this form. Characterized by rapid assembly and disassembly of business networks based on project needs, FPNs are particularly well-suited users for the proposed research.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We call our technology SEEK - Scalable Extraction of Enterprise Knowledge. Knowledge extraction is difficult because data resident in the firm does not map directly to the input needed by a decision support system. Existing approaches do not support SEEK&amp;apos;s fundamental capabilities: (1) rapid connection to legacy data and applications with little programmatic setup; and (2) linking source knowledge with decision support tools not natively available to the source. Our novel approach to provide these capabilities is to use encoded domain knowledge about the types of information that would be stored in applications to enable semiautomatic connection to those applications. Our approach is application independent, supporting extraction of legacy data from both structured and unstructured sources. This approach is inherently more scalable and robust than building application specific tools. Successful conclusion of our research will significantly increase the speed and reduce the amount of human input necessary to instantiate an extended enterprise computing platform with heterogeneous sources.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research proposes to investigate the potential for enhancing communication in interdisciplinary design teams through the fundamental understanding of communication ontologies and linguistics between team members. This is a high risk, high potential research activity that brings together faculty with expertise in linguistics, materials science and engineering, english, and industrial engineering, with two industry partners - Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems and Goodyear. The risk involves the research into integrating linguistic discourse analysis with &amp;quot;speech acts&amp;quot; codification for the engineering design process. While such linguistic research has been used effectively in other domains, this is a new attempt to capture the interactions (face-to-face, written and verbal) to be mined from the design team process. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The high potential is the significance of the &amp;quot;ontology&amp;quot; tool proposed for conceptual design, where communication patterns modeling and early investigations into optimization methods to determine best scenarios could lead to a theory-based software for all engineering design. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impacts also include the interactions with the industries; where Goodyear will support the effort by proving access to design groups, direct participation in interviews and surveys, and validation feedback for the preliminary models. Raytheon will do the same.</Abstract>

<Abstract>AI research on conceptual design of physical devices has revealed the central role that teleological knowledge and reasoning play in adaptive design. A declarative teleological model of a physical device that explicitly captures the teleological relationships among the structure, behaviors and functions of its design enables localization of the modifications to the structure to achieve new functions. The ontology of teleological models provides a vocabulary for classifying, representing, indexing and accessing specific design cases, generic adaptation plans, primitive design components, and abstract design patterns. In analogy to physical devices, the PI views software artifacts as abstract devices, i.e., as abstract teleological artifacts with structures and behaviors that result in the accomplishment of desired functions. A further analogy to adaptive physical design leads to the hypothesis that teleology is a fundamental organizational principle of adaptive software design. Of course, software artifacts are also quite different from physical devices because the notions of structure, behavior, function, and teleology in the two domains are different. Thus, this project will address the following six questions: What are productive notions of structure, behavior, function, and teleology in software design? How might a declarative teleological model of a software artifact specify its functional architecture? How might teleological analysis enable localization of the modifications needed to the architecture of a software artifact to achieve new functions? How might the ontology of the teleological models of software artifacts support classification, representation, indexing and retrieval of generic adaptation plans, primitive software components, and abstract design patterns? What might be a teleology-driven process of adaptive software design? And how might these building blocks be used to support interactive software design more easily, efficiently and effectively than at present? To answer these questions, the PI will develop building blocks of teleological reasoning in adaptive software design in the form of knowledge representations, taxonomies, libraries, methods, and processes. To these ends, the PI has adopted a three-pronged approach. He will conduct detailed empirical case studies of the evolutionary histories of designs of game-playing software agents for interactive strategy games such as Freeciv and C-evo. He will develop an interactive software design environment and, for a small class of changes in the functional requirements of game-playing agents, automate the design adaptations, which will help insure that all the building blocks work well together. And he will use the interactive environment in undergraduate software engineering courses to support design adaptations for a large class of changes in the functional requirements of game-playing agents, and conduct formal experiments using control groups to evaluate the efficacy of teleological reasoning in support of adaptive software design.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: Computational artifacts, including software artifacts, are increasingly pervasive and ubiquitous. A major factor in the cost of software development is maintaining the software artifact as its design requirements evolve; even a small reduction in this cost may have a significant impact on software practice. Since this research will address the issue of software design adaptations in response to changes in functional design requirements, its potential applications are wide-ranging and open-ended, the design and development of game-playing software agents being just one example. Because the new tools developed in this project for interactive software design weill be introduced into the classroom, they will have a direct impact on the educational technology used in the computing sciences. Knowledge acquired from the project will be disseminated in conferences and journals in software engineering, design cognition and computing, AI, and game playing.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The project proposed is a continuation of the PIs ITR proposal titled &amp;quot;Collaborative Research: Marine Metadata Interoperability Project&amp;quot;, proposed as a first step in an effort to improve the ease of use of data from ocean observations by developing broader agreement within the ocean science community on &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; for marine metadata. The results of this effort included creation and maintenance of a central, community-oriented, collaboratively developed web site for oceanographic metadata. Addition tasks included references, ontology, standards, and Metadata Cookbook development, Metadata Interoperability demonstrations, and workshop.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The current proposal builds on the previous work and recent advances in computer sciences, geosciences, and the biomedical field, and provide guidance on metadata development and application in the ocean science community. The work will support the NSF priority of designing and implementing interoperable observing systems such as ORION, as well as the metadata priorities in the U.S. IOOS DMAC plan. The work will create infrastructure to directly support the successful construction and operation of these major systems, as well as interoperability of many other smaller systems. This will directly benefit the developers and users of marine data systems, including international users.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI&amp;apos;s will engage and inform the community through the continued development of the MMI website, as well as through workshops, email list servers, presentations, and peer reviewed publications. They will build on an existing wide base of support, as evidenced by the attached letters, and provide community-backed leadership toward solving the major metadata challenges in oceanographic science.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The MMI activities are a critical component of an overall strategy to provide potential users of marine data the capability to find and utilize the data they require. To NSF, MMI contributes towards providing the ability to find and more fully exploit ocean observations supported through NSF. The purpose of this proposed effort is not to develop the physical infrastructure needed to improve our ability to access, understand and use marine data, the proposed tools (both program oriented and Web-based), documentation, and outreach and training activities will provide for the enhancement of scientific and technological understanding. A program such as the MMI could potentially be an impetus towards facilitating integration across ocean, coastal and estuarine observing domains, although this will take continued funding past two year.</Abstract>

<Abstract>DMS-9504556 Goldstein The investigator intends to continue his analysis of Bohmian mechanics, which defines a deterministic dynamical system involving a novel combination of ordinary and partial differential equations having remarkable properties. The proposed research involves (1) an analysis of the possibility of relativistic extensions of Bohmian mechanics, (2) comparisons of Bohmian mechanics with the major competing alternative formulations of quantum theory, and (3) an analysis of the foundations of statistical mechanics from a Bohmian perspective. The importance of the proposed research lies in the following observations: 1) The foundations of quantum theory, the most fundamental of all physical theories, continue to be mired in confusion and incoherence some sixty-five years after its inception. 2) Bohmian mechanics is the natural embedding of Schroedinger&amp;apos;s equation, which is the mathematical core of almost all interpretations of quantum theory, into a clear, precise physical theory. It emerges if one merely insists that this equation be directly relevant to the motion of particles. In other words, Bohmian mechanics arises, roughly speaking, from Schroedinger&amp;apos;s equation when (perhaps naively) we insist upon the simplest ontology---particles described by their positions---and seek a natural law of motion for this ontology. 3) All the mysteries of quantum theory find a compelling explanation in Bohmian mechanics---in effect, in the obvious ontology evolving in the obvious way! 4) An appreciation of Bohmian mechanics can be the source of enormous flexibility and clarity when one attempts to apply quantum theory in new directions---for example, to understand the implications of macroscopic interference effects---and to new domains, such as quantum cosmology. 5) The underlying principle behind the value of Bohmian mechanics is that it really does help to formulate physical theories with sufficient clarity that they can genuinely be understood.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This SGER addresses the problem of metaphoric inference in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Language is fundamentally a creative act and NLU systems require extensive semantic knowledge and sophisticated inference methods that are capable of dealing with figurative language. A prototypical example of the power of figurative language in everyday discourse is the ubiquitous use of metaphor to perform most linguistic functions including predication, modification, and reference.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;To date, no comprehensive computational system addressing all the aspects of metaphor has been implemented or even designed. Our project seeks to remedy this situation by addressing key challenges in building a scalable, open source, model of metaphor. Building on previous modeling work and leveraging results from Cognitive Linguistics, we are exploring techniques to a) design and populate a machine readable metaphor ontology, b) analyze the metaphoric encoding of crucial discourse information, including event structure and communicative intent, and c) use machine learning algorithms for metaphor recognition from textual sources.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;On a practical scale, this project provides a machine readable ontology of metaphors, allowing programmatic access to the relational structure of the data, enhancing reuse, and fostering incremental development. Coupled with the metaphor recognition tools, this takes us part way (a companion requirement is a corpus annotation effort) toward creating an open and scalable metaphor resource. From the scientific side, this project creates a better understanding of the form and content of metaphoric inference and the first computational framework to explore the automatic processing of this information from text languages and media.</Abstract>

<Abstract>(This award is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009: Public Law 111-5).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This is a CAREER award to support the research of Dr. Hongfang Liu in the Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Biomathematics at Georgetown University. Dr. Liu is a second-year, tenure-track Assistant Professor. Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and linguistics which develops algorithmns to locate concepts in free text; ontologies (ie. common, defined volcabulary) must be created to capture the meaning of the free text. The research field of this investigator is in the use of NLP for biological knowledge management. Specifically she will build NLP systems for protein form curation. NLP systems will be used for retrieving articles, highlighting sentences, and extracting events/relationships related to protein forms and used as a basis for curating proteins. Since one gene can produce multiple protein forms which differ in sequence, chemistry, and function, a systematic analysis of proteomics data is needed for accurate annotations of genes and their corresponding protein forms. A NLP system can be constructed by taking advantage of knowledge from existing NLP systems and the targeted end users of the system. The project is engaging various communities such as molecular database developers, NLP researchers, and basic biology scientists, as the expert knowledge base for tools development. All of the NLP tools for protein curation will be posted on the Liu lab website: http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/hl224/?action=viewgeneral&amp;amp;PageTemplateID=225&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;As a part of her CAREER plan, Dr. Liu is providing research-oriented educational experiences for students and young researchers, especially in NLP and in ontology-based knowledge management in biology. Several web-based mini courses are being developed to provide biological domain-specific introduction to ontology, NLP, and ontology-based tools. The courses will be distributed publically. The research team includes a post-doctoral associate and doctoral student and interns from related degree programs at Georgetown and from nearby universities, including several historically minority schools such as Howard University and University of the District of Columbia. These collaborations will increase the participation of women and minorities and others under-represented in science and technology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Advancing knowledge in the biological sciences involves&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;experimentally testing hypothesesand interpreting the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;results based on prior scientific work. Researchers face &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the challenge of collecting, evaluating and integrating &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;large amounts of different kinds of information about &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;organisms, cells, genes and proteins to generate a valid&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;hypothesis. And once a hypothesis is generated, the challenge &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is to evaluate the hypothesis with respect to what &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is already known. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Our proposed research will:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. Test the scalability and extensibility of a novel &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; computer system that allows biologists to construct &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; and evaluate alternative hypotheses against a knowledge &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; base on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Test a knowledge archive that supports the archiving &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; and search of validated hypotheses.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In our work, we define a hypothesis as a statement about &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;relationships between components of a biological system &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that are intended to explain experimental observations. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A set of validated hypotheses can be used as building blocks &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to construct larger, more complex models such as &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;pathways. We plan to develop and test a new paradigm: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that of hypothesis-driven querying of model organism knowledgebases. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed work, called HyQue (for Hypothesis-based Querying &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of pathway models), will take as input working hypotheses about&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;pathway models expressed in a knowledge-based formalism, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;evaluate their consistency using existing data in a knowledgebase, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and provide as output contradictory evidence and suggestions for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;improving hypotheses. HyQue will incorporate formal knowledge &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;representations based upon Semantic Web standards and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;an ontology to represent biological objects and relationships.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;HyQue will also contain a library of rules that determine &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;counts of support and contradiction for a given hypothesis. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We will prototype an archive of hypotheses that allows users &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to compare their hypothesis with other hypotheses submitted by &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;their peers. We will explore the capability to:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; (1) express working hypotheses about the yeast cell cycle; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; (2) provide integration of data in the Saccharomyces Genome &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Database to evaluate/test pathway-specific hypotheses; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; (3) archive these results. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;As analytical tools and database resources proliferate, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biologists require facilities to integrate existing data &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;into knowledge that can create a shared understanding of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biological models. Our work will explore the expressivity &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and scalability of unique and novel querying and contradiction based &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;reasoning methods that use rich formal knowledge specifications of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biological events in order to accomplish information integration. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Our proposed work will lead to a novel paradigm of querying &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;biological knowledge that can dynamically retrieve, integrate and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interpret information in terms of biologically relevant &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;relationships asserted as pathway models. Our work will &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;examine the value of Semantic Web technologies in building &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;a knowledgebase for such querying and reasoning and will &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;aid in standardizing models of biological knowledge and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;add momentum to a range of ongoing ontology building efforts. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Further information on the project can be found at the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;project web page: http://nigam.web.stanford.edu/hyque</Abstract>

<Abstract>9514695 CAREY Language is perhaps the most important conceptual capacity that separates human beings from our primate cousins. This research will explore the origins of human language, both evolutionarily and in the developing child. The focus will be on some of the numerical concepts that play an important role in the grammars of natural languages, i.e., quantifiers such as &amp;quot;one, another, some,&amp;quot; the distinction between countable entities (such as objects) and noncountable entities (such as sand and liquids), and concepts of specific countable entities (such as bottles and books). The research will attempt to discover which of these concepts are available before the emergence of language in the developing child, which emerge as the infant learns their expression in a natural language, and which are available independently of language in primates, such as rhesus monkeys and cottontop tamarins. The method to be used to probe the conceptual capacity of creatures without language is simply to show magic tricks, essentially impossible events, and record when the creature registers surprise by looking for a long time at the outcome of such impossible events. If a creature is surprised at the magic trick, we can be confident that he or she conceptualized the property of the natural world that was violated in the trick. For example, earlier research has demonstrated that if infants are shown one object placed behind a screen, and then a second object, (i.e., 1 + 1), and then the screen is lowered, revealing 2 objects (the possible outcome), they show little interest. But if the screen is lowered revealing 3 objects or just 1 object, they look reliably longer at these impossible outcomes. This method has been used for many years to study the concepts of human babies, and recent research has demonstrated shown that it also yields interpretable results both with rhesus monkeys in the wild and with laboratory-housed cottontop tamarins. ***</Abstract>

<Abstract>Role of information technology (IT) is recognized to be a critical component in the effort of improving national security, including homeland defense. Applications of importance to national security, such as aviation security, pose significant challenges to current information technology and provide excellent source for further research in developing next generation IT solutions. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Recently, there is significant advance in applying techniques from database and information systems, knowledge representation, AI, information retrieval including text categorization, lexical and language analysis and others in developing a new generation of semantic technologies. Semantic technologies help in associating meaning of data and in more meaningfully organizing data, in meaningfully correlating data, as well as in converting data into information for more effective decision making and in finding information that contextually relevant to users&amp;apos; needs. They help with syntactic and representational as well as semantic interoperability. This general area of research is also getting renewed attention now that there is considerable excitement in the vision of the Semantic Web, characterized as the next phase of the Web.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Results from several of our past and continuing research projects have led to the development a semantic technology called Semantic Content Organization and Retrieval Engine (SCORE). Using SCORE&amp;apos;s ability to quickly create ontology-driven agents without programming, it has been possible to (a) quickly create and maintain large knowledge bases (such as over one million entities and relationships per domain) base from multiple semi structured and structured sources of knowledge in largely (but not fully) automated ways, and (b) ability to create semantic (domain specific) metadata from unstructured (text), semi structured and structured sources of static and dynamic (e.g., query driven) content. This technology has also been commercialized and is being used in aviation security and intelligence applications. While specifics of these applications cannot be discussed due to government and agency regulations, and many technologically possible capabilities have yet to pass through policy considerations, we imagine a prototype application of homeland security interest that help in identifying and screening a passenger with respect to security risk to develop requirements for relevant IT research. Two important challenges posed by such an application include (a) rapid identification of semantic associations involving entities (such as a passenger or a group of passengers on a flight), and (b) knowledge discovery that identify semantic associations of interest (such as those that may pose a risk).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Our goal is to research new techniques and improving effectiveness of techniques to identify semantic associations and knowledge discovery by exploiting a large knowledge base. Specific objectives include (a) ontology driven lazy semantic metadata extraction (i.e., annotation) to complement traditional active metadata extraction techniques, and (c) formal modeling and high-performance computation of semantic association discovery including ontology-based contextual processing and relevancy ranking of interesting relationships. Our approach involves bootstrapping earlier research on semantic metadata extraction, multi-ontology query processing and other tools from on-going InfoQuilt project so that we can create knowledge bases and metadata from publicly available sources to enable meaningful evaluation of the techniques.</Abstract>

<Abstract>SES 0211011&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Many Foundations of Newtonian Dynamics&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Lawrence Sklar, University of Michigan&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;From its earliest days Newtonian dynamics has been formulated in terms of a variety of foundational principles. The initial varied foundations proliferated in the 18th and 19th centuries, and this variety of possible foundational versions of the theory was augmented by a number of important additional reconstructions of the theory&amp;apos;s first principles in the 20th century. Some of these alternative foundations of the theory were motivated by considerations of mathematical simplicity or elegance, or were generated primarily out of the desire to find versions of the theory particularly suitable for problem solving in novel ranges of applications of the theory. But a number of the alternative foundations were strongly motivated by the desire to provide resources that would help resolve long-standing interpretive issues with the theory.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project provides some discussion of the historical development of the panoply of alternative foundations for the theory. The primary goal of the research, however, is to explore a number of philosophical, methodological and interpretive issues that reveal how the possibility of alternative reconstructions of the theory plays its role in ongoing interpretive debates. The PI focuses on a number of foundational structures for the theory, including contemporary axiomatizations, contemporary Machian versions of the theory, and versions of the theory that rely on using spacetime concepts from relativistic theories, to reconstruct Newtonian dynamics and gravitational theory, and contemporary foundations based on extremal principles. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Three specific issues are to be treated. First, exponents of alternative axiomatizations of Newtonian dynamics have taken deeply opposed attitudes toward the concept of &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; in the theory. Is force an uneliminable component of the ontology required by the theory, or can its place be given a completely representationalist account? How do the new axiomatic reconstructions play into the (very old) debate? Second, three separate foundational reconstructions can play important roles in the famous debates about the nature of space and time, debates reaching back to the controversy between Leibniz and Newton at the very beginnings of the theory. Structuralist axiomatizations provide a newly coherent approach to a representationalist version of the theory that can be used both by substantivalists and relationists to back up their claims. Third, the spacetime versions of the theory relying on apparatus retro-fitted to the theory from special and general relativity provide a new context in which the old ontological debate can gain new insights. Contemporary Machianism provides, perhaps, the version of the theory most suited to the relationist. But its nature and its relation to the orthodox theory opens up many interesting questions about what it is to iointerpretli a foundational theory.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Contemporary formalizations of the theory that ground it in an extremal principle allow us new insights into the question of the legitimacy of such modes of explanation as fundamental to a theory, rather than as mere derivatives from a causal mode of explanation.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Doug Miller&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;EAR-0533644&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This award will initiate a cyberinfrastructure to promote interdisciplinary research investigating the zone defined by the outer limits of vegetation and the lower boundary of ground water, identified by the National Research Council as the Critical Zone. A complex interplay of physical, chemical, and biological reactions controls processes within this Critical Zone and has become the focus of research among a community of scientists derived from ecology, soil science, biology, geochemistry, hydrology, and geomorphology. An interdisciplinary team of scientists from these disciplines created the Weathering System Science Consortium (WSSC) in 2003 specifically to advance study of the Critical Zone. In an NSF-sponsored meeting in 2005, this consortium proposed a program the Critical Zone Exploration Network (CZEN) to study four broad research questions targeting the Critical Zone. CZEN is envisioned as a network of sites, people, tools, and ideas, which will investigate the response of the Critical Zone to global change, will promote systematic data and sample collection, will provide databases and sample storage facilities, and will train the next generation of Critical Zone scientists. The CZEN cyberinfrastructure must meet the needs of scientists from an array of disciplines and institutions. Many of these disciplines have their own conceptualizations, nomenclature, and methodologies for weathering processes. This research project will develop an integrative language (an ontology) for Critical Zone Science that will serve to bridge discipline boundaries. Building this ontology through a community-based effort will not only produce a focused, highly integrative communication standard for advancing the science of the Critical Zone, it will foster new collaboration and partnerships among groups that have not traditionally interacted. The development of this cyberinfrastructure will centralize Critical Zone data and metadata and increase usefulness of Critical Zone studies. A web-based knowledge-management environment to facilitate collaboration and sharing of data collected world-wide will be created to meet these goals. This project will contribute directly to the developing CZEN initiative by fostering interaction among the wide range of scientists and scientific disciplines that study the earths Critical Zone.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Science and Society Social Studies of Science, Engineering, and Technology Program Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide research funding for a Ph.D student to help her complete her dissertation on the local negotiation of psychiatric diagnostic categories, in particular the discourses, technologies, and practices used in negotiations with obsessive compulsive disorder, and in turn, the novel subjectivities and social formations to which the category gives rise. Over the last twenty years the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -- a tool which provides standardized criteria for the diagnosis of psychiatric conditions -- has grown considerably in size and scope, a notable development since its definitions of mental disorders have become increasingly integral to the psychiatric conceptualization/management of mental suffering. While this trend has stimulated much research within the sociology of mental health, limited attention has been given to issues related to the category of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), even though OCD holds the reputation of being the fourth most common mental disorder found in the US population (Krochmalik &amp;amp; Menzies 2003: 18). OCD moreover is regarded as a chronic, poorly understood condition, meaning that, for many, dealing with a diagnosis signifies perpetual negotiation with the ambiguities inherent to this category. In addition to filling this substantive gap, this dissertation proposal seeks to extend technoscience studies of medical practices to the realm of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;psychiatric practices, redressing the shortage of empirical research on the use of [psychiatric] diagnoses (Manning 2001: 78). Examining local engagements with psychiatric diagnoses holds the potential to illuminate the utility of such categories, alternative modes of imagining and managing mental suffering (which, in the case of those who have received a psychiatric clinical diagnosis, often emerge through interactions with the official conceptualization), as well as lived experiences. This dissertation project proposes the following research question: How is obsessive compulsive disorder negotiated within and between three spaces through which it travels: the academic research laboratory, the clinic, and the lives of those who have been diagnosed as such? By examining negotiations within and between multiple communities, the dialectical processes through which the official ontology is reproduced, or alternative ontologies are imagined, can be studied. Funding for this proposal supports research expenses related to interviewing members of these communities, as well as travel expenses and fees required for participant-observation at the conferences and group therapy sessions attended by those who treat, and those diagnosed with, obsessive compulsive disorder. This dissertation makes a theoretical contribution to the sociology of mental health by opening a space for the study of the practices and material/discursive tools employed in the negotiation of psychiatric diagnostic categories; this study additionally seeks to prompt a return to qualitative empirical study of chronic mental disorders, which in the last few decades has been overshadowed by discursive studies of psychiatry and epidemiological studies of mental illness (Mulvaney 2001). Furthermore and as noted above, this study seeks to extend technoscience studies of medical practice to the field of psychiatric practice, thereby broadening the purview of this subdivision of science and technology studies. As for its broader impact, a critical, yet nondismissive, qualitative empirical study of a psychiatric category potentially will open a space for similar types of research, thereby (a) increasing the existing knowledge of psychiatric categories from the perspectives of those negotiating them, and (b) ultimately paving the way toward a greater collaboration between qualitative sociologists and mental health professionals, and thus potentially incorporating the results of empirical qualitative research into the design of clinical and/or community-based management practices.</Abstract>

<Abstract>New methodologies have opened up the possibility of discovering how young infants perceive the world around them, and even how they think about it. This research will examine the relations between infants&amp;apos; representations of objects and substances and early language learning. The studies will establish the ways in which language learning requires children to conceputalize the world in new terms and the ways in which language learning simply requires children to learn how their language expresses the concepts they already possess. One series of studies will explore how babies establish representations of distinct objects in their environment, and how they track identity of these objects over time. Previous research has discovered a change in the criteria for object individuation and object identity beginning around eleven months of age that is related to learning to comprehend object labels. Other series of studies will explore the processes underlying word learning by 2- to 4-year-old children, documenting continuing changes in lexical representations throughout the preschool years. These studies will shed light on fundamental questions concerning the relations between language and thought. Furthermore, they will contribute to a deeper understanding of normal language and cognitive development, in terms of which abnormal development can be better understood.</Abstract>

<Abstract>9860316l&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Material and process specifications are vital for any organization involved in complex manufacturing. Specifications (specs) are often comprehensive and voluminous, covering hundreds of characteristics such as the material properties, testing parameters, and processing requirements. The methods used to review and analyze specs, however, are labor-intensive, time consuming, and all too often produce results that have a negative impact on quality. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Renaissance Engineering, Inc. seeks to create a conceptual design for tools which provide computer-assistance in the interpretation of spec requirements based on the theories of Information Extraction. The project bases the analysis of specification content on an emerging meta-specification created as a result of previous NSF support. This meta-specification provides ontology for capturing and re-using the semantic knowledge contained in the body of specs. The tools created as a result of this research would be used to convert existing test-based specs into the computer-sensible ontology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Tools that access specifications in an intelligent, computerized format such as those proffered by Renaissance Engineering are of importance to the many organizations that have their processing, inspecting, and testing controlled by specifications including the Federal Government, and suppliers and prime contractors for many industries, particularly aerospace, automotive, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project explores three new related approaches to making the indexing and retrieval of videos (1) more efficient by developing rapid feature selection, (2) more meaningful by devising measurably useful indexing ontologies, and (3) more humanly navigable by demonstrating integrated multimedia browsers, even when the videos are unedited.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The first approach consists of heuristic adaptations of machine learning algorithms to the overly redundant data that is video. The second approach consists of using statistical tools to examine the descriptive tags that can be affixed to video segments, in order to measure and refine their quality. The third approach consists of exploiting the first two approaches to discover and display the weak structure that is latent even in the unedited videos of student presentations. The experimental research will be refined by continuing user studies, involving students from middle school, high school, college, and post-graduates.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results of this project will provide advances at the multiple intersections of computer vision, machine learning, data management, information retrieval, ontology design, user interface technology, and user studies, with possible applications in the wider areas of sensory retrieval in general.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts: We expect that the browser will enhance the effectiveness of undergraduate education by allowing accurate and rapid review of both instructor and student recorded presentations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We also expect that the underlying novel technologies will permit real-time analysis and access of more standard videos. The project Web site (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jrk/unstructured) will be used to disseminate resulting publications, open-source code, and instructions on how to obtain annotated video data sets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The empirical component of the linguistics sciences has seen a rapid increase in the amount of data available in digital form. Though there have been recent advances in markup languages, Web protocols, and techniques for data management, linguistics as a whole has not been able to take full advantage of them. For instance, individual sets of linguistic data are often encapsulated in forms that are not compatible with others: linguistic data are not generally interoperable. This is in part because linguistics has only begun to develop field-wide, best-practice resources for managing its data, including common software tools, Web infrastructures, and knowledge components such as ontologies. Such resources would, in fact, act as the backbone for any field-wide cyberinfrastructure effort. Towards such a goal, then, this collaborative project will implement the GOLD Community of Practice, a Web architecture for linking on-line linguistic data to linguistic knowledge captured by the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD). The component of the project, led by Fei Xia and William D. Lewis, will address the issue of legacy data by harvesting large amounts of interlinear glossed text from the Web. The results will be transformed into a best-practice format and stored in the Online Database of INterlinear text (ODIN). Second, Helen Aristar-Dry and Anthony Aristar will focus on the direct creation of best-practice data by further developing FIELD, a tool that allows field linguists to produce high quality lexical data. Finally, Scott Farrar will instantiate the resulting best-practice data in the GOLD framework, thus integrating data from the first two components. The research team will then demonstrate the efficacy of project by implementing an ontology-driven search facility that incorporates the general knowledge of linguistics with the specific knowledge captured by the data instances. To ensure that the resulting architecture gets wide exposure, we will house the results of this project at the LINGUIST List where it can be seen and evaluated by the linguistics community as a whole.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will allow ordinary working linguistics and anyone with an interest in human language to search and see generalizations across large amounts of linguistic data. It will directly address the key issues involved in the comparison and integration data that were not originally intended to be comparable. These include the leveraging of existing resources (i.e., legacy data from the Web), taking advantage of best-practice data standards, and utilizing field-wide knowledge. These issues present significant technological challenges, as there are no general off-the-shelf solutions for given domains such as linguistics. The success of the project requires a deep understanding of linguistic data objects and structures. In fact, the project will demonstrate how the fundamental data structures of the field can be utilized in a broader framework. At a time when the world stands to lose much of its linguistic diversity, this project will result in a community-wide resource usable for its intrinsic value as a search tool to explore the structure of all kinds of human languages. At the present, there are no such search tools available for linguistic data. When users see the value in contributing to such an effort, they will be more likely to embrace the accompanying data standards and tools. Thus, what the project will achieve is a community of linguists dedicated to the production of quality data resources for the common goal of affecting the next great advance in our understanding of the structures of language.</Abstract>

The results will be transformed into a best-practice format and stored in the Online Database of INterlinear text (ODIN). Second, Helen Aristar-Dry and Anthony Aristar will focus on the direct creation of best-practice data by further developing FIELD, a tool that allows field linguists to produce high quality lexical data. Finally, Scott Farrar will instantiate the resulting best-practice data in the GOLD framework, thus integrating data from the first two components. The research team will then demonstrate the efficacy of project by implementing an ontology-driven search facility that incorporates the general knowledge of linguistics with the specific knowledge captured by the data instances. To ensure that the resulting architecture gets wide exposure, we will house the results of this project at the LINGUIST List where it can be seen and evaluated by the linguistics community as a whole.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will allow ordinary working linguistics and anyone with an interest in human language to search and see generalizations across large amounts of linguistic data. It will directly address the key issues involved in the comparison and integration data that were not originally intended to be comparable. These include the leveraging of existing resources (i.e., legacy data from the Web), taking advantage of best-practice data standards, and utilizing field-wide knowledge. These issues present significant technological challenges, as there are no general off-the-shelf solutions for given domains such as linguistics. The success of the project requires a deep understanding of linguistic data objects and structures. In fact, the project will demonstrate how the fundamental data structures of the field can be utilized in a broader framework. At a time when the world stands to lose much of its linguistic diversity, this project will result in a community-wide resource usable for its intrinsic value as a search tool to explore the structure of all kinds of human languages. At the present, there are no such search tools available for linguistic data. When users see the value in contributing to such an effort, they will be more likely to embrace the accompanying data standards and tools. Thus, what the project will achieve is a community of linguists dedicated to the production of quality data resources for the common goal of affecting the next great advance in our understanding of the structures of language.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the outdated methods by which companies use material and process specifications. Specifications are a fact of life for any organization involved in complex manufacturing (e.g., aerospace, automotive, materials). Specifications are comprehensive and voluminous documents, covering hundreds of different key characteristics. The constant reading, checking, and analyzing of specifications is extremely labor-intensive, quality-impacting, and time-consuming. During Phase I research, the feasibility of the concept was successfully determined, and a conceptual design solution for tools was created which provides computer-assistance in the interpretation of specification requirements. The conceptual solution is based on the theories of Information Extraction and the analysis of specification content within the context of a meta-specification created as a result of prior NSF-sponsored research. This meta-specification provides an ontology for capturing the semantic knowledge contained in the text of specifications. The Phase II objectives are to build a working prototype of the solution as the foundation for potential full-scale commercialization. The tools created as a result of this prototype will be used to convert existing text-based specifications into the computer-sensible ontology. The Phase II solution is not attempting to totally automate the interpretation process. Instead, the focus is on innovative approaches for providing computer assistance in the semantic analysis of a limited domain of documents. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The organizations which have their processing, inspecting, and testing controlled by specifications are extremely interested in using tools that access specifications in an intelligent, computerized format. These organizations include the United States Government as well as suppliers and prime contractors in American industry. This effort could &amp;apos;jump-start&amp;apos; an entire industry related to providing tools for the computer-assisted analysis of specification requirements.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The volume of educational resources available to students is rapidly increasing. In a&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;wide variety of subject domains, educational resources are now available on the Web&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and in educational Digital Libraries. The abundance of resources has created the need&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to provide personalized access to educational resources, i.e., to help students find,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;organize, and use resources that match their individual goals, interests, and current&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;knowledge. This project answers that need by developing and exploring a broad range&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of innovative techniques for personalized access to open corpus educational resources.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Among these techniques are adaptive navigation support and adaptive visualization&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques, which offer a higher level of interactivity and expressive power and take into&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;account not only the users&amp;apos; interests, but also their current knowledge and goals. To&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;integrate the results of this research into education, we are developing a system that&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;uses the most promising techniques to provide students in undergraduate programming&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;courses at the University of Pittsburgh with personalized access to a large volume of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;diverse open corpus resources. This system serves as a major evaluation platform for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the techniques being developed.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;By focusing on personalized access to educational resources, the project provides&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;short-term and long-term broader impacts. The system developed in the course of this&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;project maximizes educational opportunities for every student in several large,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;programming-related undergraduate courses at the University of Pittsburgh. Widely&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;disseminated through publications and the project&amp;apos;s web site, our personalized&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information access techniques help thousands of students to harness the educational&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;power of the Web and Digital Libraries.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~taler/pacer.html</Abstract>

<Abstract>Print-based textbooks and educational materials supporting the general curriculum present an accessibility barrier for many students, especially those with disabilities. Digital curricular materials and technology-based learning environments provide alternatives by presenting the same content as printed materials, but in formats that are flexible and accessible. In order provide students with appropriately customized learning experiences in a timely fashion and at scale, automatic generation of adapted content is essential.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project introduces the concept of a pedagogical intent ontology to drive the semantic annotation of XML-based digital educational content. The formal description of the pedagogical semantics of individual chunks of educational content and the relationships among those chunks of content, together with a student model, will drive the selection, sequencing, layout and presentation of educational content. The project will develop foundational knowledge and infrastructure components including (1) a pedagogical intent ontology, (2) semantic annotation schemes, (3) an architecture for automated, rule-based adaptation of content, (4) introduction of new models of curriculum design, and (5) research results to shape and justify the adoption of new approaches to, and standards for, the design of educational materials by the publishing community, such as the National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Intellectual Merit - This study will develop a phylogeny and classification for the fishes of the Order Cypriniformes, the largest group of entirely freshwater fishes in the world with 3,285 described, and as many as 2,600 undescribed species. This group contains the minnows, suckers, loaches, river loaches and algae eaters. Many of these fishes have economic and scientific importance. Several large carp are an important protein source in Asia, and paradoxically, are nuisance, invasive species in North America. The zebrafish is a model organism for developmental biologists; the fathead minnow is used as an indicator species in environmental work; and goldfish are widely studied by physiologists. Many species are kept by aquarists, a hobby that has vast educational and economic impacts. Our project is international in scope with 27 collaborators, including some of the most prominent cypriniform systematists from across the globe. The group includes paleontologists, neontologists, developmental biologists, and molecular systematists. We will develop phylogenies using genomic data for a set of nuclear and mitochondrial genes, including a subset of complete mitochondrial genomes as well as morphological data from fossil and extant species. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts - The phylogeny, including the developmental information, will broaden the scope of work based on the zebrafish and other model species, and will produce a stable classification. We will describe new species, expanding our understanding of biodiversity. Our study has significant broader impacts beyond pure research with student education in systematics, evolution, biodiversity, development, and morphology, international collaboration, and critical information on model organisms like the zebrafish, fathead minnow, and goldfish. The prncipal and co-principal investigators reresent a diverse group of scientists at many career stages (2 of 10 are female; 2 of 10 are minorities; 2 of 10 have physical disabilities; 5 of 10 are new investigators) and come from diverse institutions (3 private universities and 4 public universities; 4 of the institutions are in EPSCoR jurisdictions). A NOVA television program will be produced and public meetings will be held. Information will be disseminated via a project web portal (http://bio.slu.edu/mayden/cypriniformes/projects.html) as well as conventional scientific publication.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Deep language understanding involves mapping language to a formalism that captures its intended meaning in context, using concepts and relations in an ontology that supports reasoning. It is generally thought that deep understanding is too difficult to accomplish except in very limited domains. As a result, most of the field has shifted to studying so-called shallow methods. Work in shallow language processing has been greatly enhanced in recent years due to the availability of considerable annotated corpora and off-the-shelf software. If one had to build this infrastructure from scratch, then most current work in the field would not be feasible. Despite the successes of shallow language understanding, however, one cannot, for instance, build sophisticated dialogue systems or NL interfaces to intelligent systems, (e.g., humanrobot interaction) using off-the-shelf shallow components. For these and many other applications, we need deeper understanding. However, there are currently no resources or toolkits to support deep understanding. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This planning grant focuses on identifying the resources that the research community would find most useful and exploring what would be useful APIs to this resource (e.g., deep semantic parsers, semantic lexicons and ontologies, discourse processing capabilities such as ontology-based reference resolution, surface speech act interpretation). The interested communities fall into two broad camps. The first are what we might call technology users, people who want to use deep understanding capabilities but whose research interests are in some other area of intelligent systems (e.g., reasoning, learning, image interpretation, robotics). The second camp, technology developers, consist of researchers in NLP who are pushing research in NLP further. A critical subpart of this second group are students studying to become natural language researchers and technology developers. Through a series of case studies and a workshop, we explore the viability of different delivery mechanisms and needs for the different types of users and for different applications.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Data Protection laws that exempt data that is not individually&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;identifiable have led to an explosion in anonymization research.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Unfortunately, how well current de-identification and anonymization&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques control risks to privacy and confidentiality is not well&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;understood. Neither is the usefulness of anonymized data for real-world&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;applications. The project addresses anonymization on three fronts:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) Textual data, even when explicit identifiers are removed (names,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;dates, locations), can contain highly identifiable information. For&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;example, a sample of chief complaint fields from the Indiana Network&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for Patient Care (INPC) found several instances of &amp;quot;phantom limb&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;pain&amp;quot;. Amputees can be visually identifiable, but the HIPAA Safe&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Harbor rules do not list this as &amp;quot;identifying information&amp;quot;. Any&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;policy explicitly listing all types of identifying data is likely to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;fail. Through a joint effort with computer science and linguistics,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the project is developing new methods to remove specific details from&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;text while preserving meaning, eliminating such highly identifiable&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information without a priori knowledge of what would be identifying.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) Current anonymization research is based on unproven measures of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;identifiability. Through a re-identification challenge on synthetic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;data (but based on real healthcare data), the project is evaluating&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the efficacy of these measures. Interdisciplinary teams of students&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;are given challenge problems - anonymized data with hypothetical&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;healthcare data - and asked to make (hypothetical) inferences about&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;health information of individuals. The results can be used to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;calibrate the effectiveness of different anonymization measures.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) The utility of anonymized data has been a concern among research:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Does anonymized data provide credible research results? By partnering&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;with healthcare studies at the Kinsey Institute and Purdue University&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;School of Nursing, the project is comparing analyses on original data&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;with analyses on anonymized data, and evaluating the impact of types&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of anonymization on research results. A related issue is determining&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the impact on data collection: Are individuals more candid in their&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;responses if they know data will be anonymized? Outcomes are broadening&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the scope of research that can be performed on anonymized data, while&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ensuring that researchers know when access to individually identifiable&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;data (with attendant restrictions and safeguards) is needed.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Through these tasks, the project is advancing our ability to utilize&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the wealth of data we now collect for the benefit of society, while&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ensuring individual privacy is protected.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/TextAnon</Abstract>

<Abstract>In recent years, numerous paradoxes have arisen which raise questions about what can be inferred about a quantum system based on its theoretically calculated quantities, such as weights and probabilities and, more recently, its ``weak values&amp;apos;&amp;apos;--- time-symmetric quantities applicable to pre- and post-selected systems. The proposed research would apply to the analysis of these problems a somewhat neglected interpretation of quantum theory, namely the ``Transactional Interpretation&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (TI) of John Cramer (1980). TI proposes that quantum events are mediated by spacetime ``transactions&amp;apos;&amp;apos; consisting of a distinctive type of interaction between the usual future-directed (&amp;quot;retarded&amp;quot;) and past-directed, &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; waves. The proposed research consists in applying the transactional model to current thought experiments such as Hardy&amp;apos;s experiment (1992) and the three-state paradox, both of which present conceptual difficulties, and investigating how this application affects what conclusions are possible concerning the ontology of the systems involved in such experiments. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The proposed project&amp;apos;s intellectual value lies in its direct bearing on longstanding problems in the interpretation of quantum theory, in particular the ontological status of quantum systems between measurements, which remains deeply obscure under the standard time-asymmetric approach. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; In terms of broader implications, the project is also of historical value in its examination of an under-recognized proposal of several decades ago. A study of this neglected interpretation sheds light on the reasons for its neglect and on what those reasons tell us about human expectations of physical theories---i.e., what such theories should assume about the world, as well as what kind of information they should provide. In particular, humans have a very compelling intuition about the temporal ordering of cause and effect, and this intuition tends to constrain the construction and interpretation of theories. TI denies that intuition. Yet it appears to offer effective solutions to longstanding puzzles of quantum theory such as ``wave function collapse&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (exactly where/when/how does it occur?) and the problem of measurement. If TI is the correct way to interpret quantum theory, this implies that humans need not view the past as equivalent to ``what has already happened&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; certain aspects of the past might remain open to change based on future events. Such an understanding radically changes the relationship of humans to their world of experience, both inner and outer, in a way that has the potential to extend beyond basic intellectual understanding (as in puzzle-solving) to cultural and societal possibilities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Considering the popularity and wide adoption of social network systems and the competitive edge these systems provide, there has been a rapid growth in use of these systems to access, store, and exchange personal attribute information in distributed and/or federated environments and this trend is expected to continue. Efficient, secure, and user-centric techniques are important for the successful deployment of such systems. Our goal in this project is to develop a comprehensive and compelling framework SNGuard (Social Network Guard) that satisfies diverse privacy properties, access control issues, identity management requirements, and usage patterns. The vision of dynamic social networks is a complex and highly sophisticated one that requiring ongoing research and analysis to continue concurrent with the changing role and face of digital information creation and usage including personal information and contents in social networks. The principal intellectual products resulting from this project will be the development of novel frameworks to facilitate user-centered privacy management, content management and risk-aware access control, thereby making SNGuard solutions more trustworthy, more reliable, and less vulnerable. This research effort will have broad societal impact by providing a key mechanism to enable new business and community models for the sharing of personal attributes including identity information to safely, easily, and quickly establish social networking environments in cyberspace. In addition to these potential benefits, other anticipated, broad-based benefits to be facilitated by this research include significant influence to K-12 education, international collaboration, and industrial and government partners.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The REGNET research project proposes to develop an information infrastructure to enhance the access, retrieval and transparency of government regulations, in particular in the area of patents. Almost all manufacturing and engineered products as well as the processes involved in inventing and producing such products need to comply with regulatory requirements. Patent laws and related issues are complex and voluminous, and can be disproportionately burdensome, hindering technological and business innovations, particularly to small businesses. Information technology (IT) has the potential to mitigate and help solve many of these complicated issues and enhance public understanding. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Government regulations are now available online. However, most of current online portals are primarily designed for displaying the information and are difficult to be used for further processing. The information service infrastructure proposed for REGNET includes repositories as a base and, more importantly, tools to locate, merge, compare, and analyze the information. This service infrastructure will exploit in an intelligent way the communication and computational resources that are now widely available to the public. Seven tasks are planned: (1) textual parsing and storage, (2) semi-structured, indexed storage, (3) means to resolve semantic ambiguities, (4) cross-referencing appropriate for automated retrieval of relevant documents, (5) comparative analysis of related regulatory documents, (6) on-line compliance assistance and checking of governmental regulations, and (7) needs assessment and impact analysis. New and innovative search and analysis techniques will be developed to help disseminate regulatory data and allow finding and comparing multiple sources of related legal and regulatory information. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broad Impacts &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;IT systems for legal and regulatory purposes are being rapidly developed. The social and legal impacts of such online regulation systems and compliance assistance tools as well as their effects on the regulatory process will be studied.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Understanding and sustaining the natural world in the 21st century depends on improving our capacity to access ecological, earth science, and human-dimension data; mining these data for new knowledge; and conveying new insights to decision-makers and the general public. Computer science and information technology research can effectively address many of these issues and advance our ability to conduct ecological science. This multidisciplinary research investigation will create a &amp;quot;Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge&amp;quot; (SEEK)-an information technology framework and infrastructure that will be used to derive and extend ecological knowledge by facilitating the discovery, access, integration, interpretation, and analyses of distributed ecological information. SEEK will provide for the integration of local desktop data with a larger network of data and analytical tools, enabling ecologists and other researchers to tackle complex research problems that were hitherto intractable. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The SEEK initiative stands on the foundation of substantial and productive NSF investment in ecological and biodiversity informatics and it brings together four highly collaborative, forward-looking institutions in a partnership committed to inventing and supporting a global computing infrastructure for environmental biology. The project involves a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, ecologists and technologists from the Partnership for Biodiversity Informatics (PBI), a consortium comprising the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS); the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC); the University of Kansas (KU), and the University of New Mexico (UNM)) and partnering institutions (Arizona State University, University of North Carolina, University of Vermont, and Napier University in Scotland).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This five-year initiative will lead to fundamental improvements in how researchers can 1) gain global access to data and information, 2) rapidly locate and utilize distributed computational services, and 3) exercise powerful new methods for capturing, reproducing, and extending the analysis process itself. SEEK will also specifically provide ecologists and other researchers access to a large-scale network of information resources and computational services, via powerful data discovery and analysis tools that operate from desktop computers. These capabilities will significantly build research capacity to more effectively address global research, management and policy issues in environmental biology that increasingly require much more efficient, automated access to distributed and heterogeneous data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A multi-faceted approach will be employed to insure that the research products, software, and information technology infrastructure resulting from SEEK optimally benefit science, education, and the public. Outreach includes community involvement, a WWW portal, informatics training, and an innovative annual symposium and training program that focuses on information technology transfer to young investigators and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In the information economy, access to information for knowledge creation and decision-making is as valuable as the information itself. This project will enable bringing the intellectual content of biodiversity and ecological information into currency for science and society. Examples of significant project outcomes include: (i) revolutionizing discovery, access to and integration of ecological, earth, and human dimension data and information through the SEEK infrastructure; (ii) developing intelligent analytical tools and infrastructure to support the needs of scientists, decision-makers, and the general public; (iii) education and training of the next generation of ecologists in information technology skills; and (iv) improving the opportunities for scientists, resource managers, policy makers, and the public to make scientifically-informed decisions about the environment by expanding access to ecological data, information, and knowledge.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The constant enhancements in capabilities of palmtop, embedded and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;wearable devices, together with the advent of pervasive connectivity,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;represents a new paradigm for interaction among devices. A new vista&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is open for research in the area of mobile data management where&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;mobile devices gather and exchange information from not just wired&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;sources, but also their environment and one another. Each device is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;both a data source and a data consumer pursuing its individual and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;collective tasks. New ideas are proposed for a research program aimed&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;at realizing ubiquitous computing systems based on the cooperation of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;autonomous, dynamic and adaptive components (hardware as well as&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;software) which are located in vicinity of one another. This is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;significantly different from ``infrastructure-based&amp;apos;&amp;apos; mobile&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;client/server computing between PDAs and network services. The&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;proposed research will enable a new class of applications that&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;effectively exploit mobility and pervasive computing. New prototypes&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and applications will be built in the context of mobile information&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;management within dynamic communities of ad-hoc services and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;devices. The research team is part of the eBiquity research group&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;located at The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;will closely interact with collaborators from industry including IBM,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Fujitsu, and HP.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Data mining (aka Knowledge Discovery in Databases, KDD) is a procedure to extract previously unknown and potentially useful information or pattern from huge data sets. KDD is usually a multiphase process involving numerous steps such as data preparation, data preprocessing, feature selection, rule induction, knowledge evaluation and deployment etc. Many novel data mining and learning algorithms have been developed, though vigorously, under rather add hoc and vague concepts. These algorithms, in most cases, are individual creations of different researchers, without much common methodological and fundamental framework. In other words, great majority of work in data mining is focused on algorithm development while neglecting the studies of fundamental theoretical issues concerning data, inter-data relationships, and quality of the implicit information hidden in the data or data redundancies. Thus, it is not easy to fully understand and evaluate how individual phase influences each other and the impact of each phase on the whole knowledge discovery process. For further development and breakthroughs in data mining and learning algorithms, a deep examination of its foundation is necessary. The central goal of the proposed research is to develop a unified rough set based data mining framework to explore various fundamental issues of data mining and learning algorithms. It aims to present the analytical capabilities of the methodology of rough sets in the context of data mining methodologies, techniques and applications. It will provide a unified framework to help better understand the whole KDD process.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual merit: Rough set theory is particularly suited to reasoning about imprecise or incomplete data and discovering relationships in the data. The simplicity and mathematical clarity of rough set theory makes it attractive for both theoreticians and application-oriented researchers. The main advantage of rough set theory is that it does not require any preliminary or additional information about the data, such as probability in statistics, basic probability assignment in Dempster-Shafer theory or the value of membership in fuzzy set theory. Rough set theory constitutes a sound basis for KDD and can be used in different phases of the KDD process. In particular, the formal techniques of rough set theory lead to many novel and promising breakthrough methods and algorithms for attribute functional, or&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;partial functional dependencies, their discovery, analysis, and characterization, feature election, feature extraction, data reduction, decision rule generation, and pattern extraction (templates, association rules) etc., which are the fundamental issues of the KDD process. Rough set theory represents a new innovative approach and can lead to the development of new learning algorithms to create novel uses and breakthroughs of data mining techniques.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts: The proposed collaborative project is interdisciplinary in nature. It will synthesize often-disparate work in data mining, rough set theory and high performance computing. The PIs&amp;apos; strong multidisciplinary research collaboration experience will lead to widespread awareness and impact of the proposed research to rough set, data mining and high performance computing community. It will design and develop a wide-range of novel data mining algorithms and methods including data reduction, rule induction and classification ensemble in one unified framework to better understand the whole KDD&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;process. These algorithms and methods will significantly extend the application scope of data mining techniques and rough set theory and will result in the improved understanding of issues involved in designing efficient and innovative data mining and learning algorithms and methods. The proposed research will integrate tightly with teaching activities, the research results will be developed into undergraduate and graduate courses and research projects. Part of this approach includes the development of new cross-disciplinary courses that bring together computer science and mathematics for the understanding of principle and methods of theoretical foundations of data mining and rough set theory. The integration will help with training students in the issues involved in the rough set theory, design and implementation of novel data mining methods and algorithms, high performance computing. The active participation of students will allow for significant exposure to the latest research in data&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;mining.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is an effort to improve the ease of use of data from ocean observations by developing broader agreement within the ocean science community on &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; for marine metadata. It brings together a number of segments of the ocean science community in an effort to document current usage, to develop a consensus on &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot;, and to test the best practices and their effectiveness at promoting cross-platform, cross-disciplinary data exchange in a test-bed activity. The goal is to reduce the burden of metadata generation, increase the use of metadata, and develop a general metadata structure that supports a wide variety of data usage. The test-bed will provide an end-to-end demonstration of the use of metadata &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; in an environment with heterogeneous data types.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The volume and variety of ocean data from modern observing systems are expanding rapidly and it becomes difficult to find or effectively use these data without assistance from modern data management and data analysis tools. These tools place the burden of searching for and manipulating data onto computer programs. To be able to successfully do this requires that datasets include descriptions of the data they contain, and details of how they have been obtained and processed, that are stored in a form that can be understood by these programs. To be machine-readable, this metadata must conform to semantic and syntactic standards that are understood by the programs. This project aims to combine the best of existing practices for generating metadata into recipes for voluntary de facto community standards. Experience with how to develop metadata and associated ontologies has emerged in a number of fields and this will be fused with existing marine metadata practices. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, this project will develop a more comprehensive approach to ocean metadata and facilitate its adoption by marine scientists. More complete metadata that conforms to a community standard will enhance the ability of many users to employ ocean observations more effectively. The impact is likely to be felt most directly by the academic research and &amp;quot;operational&amp;quot; ocean nowcasting or forecasting communities. Indirectly, this is likely to benefit a number of ocean data users such as coastal ocean resource managers and commercial users by easing and expanding their access to relevant data.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The World-Wide Web has become a prime vehicle for disseminating information. As a result, the number of large Web sites with complex structure and that serve information derived from multiple data sources is increasing. Building a web site involves the tasks of selecting the data that will be displayed at the site, designing the site&amp;apos;s structure, and designing the visual presentation of pages. In existing Web-site management tools, these three tasks are, for the most part, interdependent, and as a result, many maintenance tasks become tedious to perform. The goal of this research project is to develop tools for flexible construction, maintenance and management of web sites. Two specific problems are being studied in detail. The first is the development of policies for efficient run-time management of Web sites. As a part of designing such policies, novel methods for selecting which views over the underlying data can be materialized in order to speed up the performance of the site. In addition, methods are being developed for the automatic restructuring of web sites in response to user browsing patterns. The second problem under consideration is the development of an architecture in which several web-site management tools can interoperate. The goal of such an architecture is to be able to support the larger scope of tasks involved in the lifecycle of a web site, which undoubtedly will require a multitude of tools. This research program is closely coordinated with the development of a database curriculum at the University of Washington, and is carried out in collaboration with industry that is likely to lead to technology transfer with a broad impact. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://data.cs.washington.edu/</Abstract>

<Abstract>This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award. The project is designed to develop fundamental principles for natural language interfaces for the next generation of intelligent tutoring systems. Natural language interfaces to instructional and educational applications need both knowledge about how to act in a domain and communication knowledge about how to talk about acting in the domain. This project seeks to overcome the domain dependence of natural language interfaces that prevents them from being portable to other domains. It will accomplish this in two ways. First, the research will elucidate the difference between domain dependent and domain independent communication strategies. Second, it will develop a methodology, algorithms and tools to semi-automatically derive domain and communication knowledge from text and dialogues. An innovative aspect of this work is the role played by the lexical semantics of action verbs to acquire domain knowledge represented as action schemas. Among the instructional domains addressed by this research is computer science. The fact that the work concerns tutoring systems integrates the research and education components of the work, through class evaluation and undergraduate participation in research.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This CAREER award recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of a teacher-scholar who is likely to become an academic leader of the twenty-first century. Success in this research will enable the construction of improved computerized tutors, as well as advancing the general field of natural language processing. A specific educational focus is mentoring women at the undergraduate and graduate level, and supporting girls in choosing science and engineering as a career.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal will explore a number of technologies for representing, storing, and processing microarray data, applied to development of the Yale Microarray Database (YMD). Microarray data sets, while providing information about gene expression or protein interactions, present one of the significant challenges in data management. Three specific technologies are involved. Collectively these approaches will allow us to address a number of the important issues in microarray database design: (i) dealing with large-scale and diverse information; (ii) allowing data dissemination; (iii) facilitating interoperation and exchange of data among heterogeneous information resources; and (iv) supporting integrative data analysis.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. The use of the flexible EAV data modeling approach. The entity-attribute-value (EAV) approach in modeling a wide variety of sparsely populated attributes in a flexible fashion will be utilized in YMD to represent heterogeneous data including experimental conditions and multi-level analysis results. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. XML-based interoperability. XML can facilitate the conversion and merging of heterogeneous (but related) data sets from different information sources into a common format so that integrated data access can be facilitated. MAGEML (an XML-based markup language for describing gene expression data) as a common data exchange mechanism between YMD and other MIAME-compliant microarray data repositories will be developed.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3. Parallel computing. A distributed, parallel computing approach to help speed up complex queries and analyses of large amounts of gene expression data will be used, providing users with integrated access to a variety of tools.</Abstract>

This project also aims to link Russian and American traditions by building on the Moscow school of lexical semantics.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; In the study of how lexicon and grammar interact in semantic interpretation, the static view of compositionality as the simple putting together of given lexical meanings into larger wholes has been giving way to a dynamic view in which compositionality is seen in the context of the meaning-shifting potential of the parts that are being combined. Essential issues for the present project include understanding the nature and roles of fine-grained type structure and sort structure of lexical meanings and their effects, in interaction with contextual information, on meaning shifts and coercions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The project&amp;apos;s substantive focus is on controversial problems concerning the principles of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interpretation of genitives and related constructions with relational and non-relational nouns&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(John&amp;apos;s brother, John&amp;apos;s team). These constructions have sparked debates concerning the division of labor and interactions among compositional semantics, lexical semantics, and context.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Mobile computing and wireless networks have dramatically changed both the distributed systems communication paradigm and the ways that people access and manipulate information. Consequently, there is now widespread recognition of a strong need for context-aware computing in numerous application domains, particularly applications that assist in the management of emergency situations. Such applications will dynamically adjust to individual user profiles, user locations, the local environment, and the task being performed. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project focuses on context-aware computing with applications to public health management. Core research issues in data management that are relevant to context-aware computing will be investigated. Also, the architecture of a system that supports context-aware applications with dynamically evolving data will be developed. Data integration tools and ontologies will be studied and then applied to actual source data and user profiles. This activity will be augmented with techniques for building spatio-temporal context from location traces. Methodologies will be developed to ensure the scalability of the system, including the use of request aggregation and of data cubes for caching user profiles and retrieved data. Security issues will be addressed by investigating an authentication model for spatio-temporal context based on a distributed trust framework. The architecture will also incorporate a component for the arbitration of services that can manage on-demand resource allocation in a competitive environment.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the quality, responsiveness, and delivery accuracy of services using context-aware computing. The focus on health care services, both in routine and in crisis situations (e.g., terrorist attacks, natural disasters) has the potential to contribute to an improved technology infrastructure for the public health sector nationwide.</Abstract>

The multi-university center is currently comprised of Virginia Tech (lead institute), University of Central Florida and University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Carnegie Mellon University is slated to join as a full partner in 2009. The mission and vision of the NSF Center for e-Design is to serve as a national Center of Excellence in IT-enabled design and realization of manufactured products. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The University of Central Florida&amp;apos;s (UCF) participation is vital to the overall success of the Center. Continued research efforts at UCF will contribute to the development of a set of coordinated tools and practices that can support conceptual and detailed design requirements specification, as well as the development of a conceptual modeler that can be used to support iterative conceptual design. The research efforts at UCF fully align with the Center?s long-term goal of serving as a Center for Excellence in IT-enabled conceptualization, design and realization of engineered products and systems. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed Center&amp;apos;s renewal will enable UCF to continue its key research and leadership role in the Center, as well as contribute significantly to the successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students. Benefits to students will include integration of resulting work into coursework and engineering curricula, as well as internship opportunities. The center will provide a unique experience to students who can interact and collaborate with industrial researchers and engineers. Research and educational findings will continue to be disseminated nationally and will have a significant impact on US industry as a whole.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of South Dakota Main Campus is awarded a grant to develop tools to integrate evolutionary and model organism phenotype data using ontologies in order to address questions about the genetic and developmental regulation of evolutionary morphological transitions. The project will develop and apply ontologies for taxa and phenotypes in a large clade of fishes (the Ostariophysi) and to develop a suite of database and web-interface tools that will enable researchers to investigate relationships between evolutionary phenotypes and those seen in genetically characterized developmental mutants of zebrafish (a species within Ostariophysi). Combining the wealth of genomic data on the numerous phenotypic mutants for zebrafish, with the span of corresponding anatomical diversity in ostariophysan species will allow researchers to discover previously unrealized connections between evolutionary change, genes, and the developmental processes in which these genes play a role. The team will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by implementing a select number of use-case queries as a proof-of-concept. The queries will be implemented via a web-based user interface for searching and analyzing the data content. The research will be carried out in collaboration with the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center at the University of North Carolina.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Communities of scientists develop a specialized understanding of their specific domain of expertise, which manifests as differences in mental conceptualization. Within such information communities there may be quite high levels of agreement regarding conceptualization, in that members can communicate and share ideas, but insurmountable problems arise when data and knowledge must be shared between communities. But many emerging problems in science require that such disparate perspectives indeed be merged. For example, relationships between climate, land use, and ecology can have far-reaching impacts on human health via ailments such as West Nile Virus and Lyme Disease. Building predictive models that span communities and lead to proactive mitigation is only possible when the conceptual differences imbued in the data can be resolved, enabling a free exchange. Through this research project, the investigators propose an ontological approach to mediate the sharing of data resources among different information communities across the environmental sciences, ranging from human health exposures and outcomes to climate forecasts and climate-change predictions. Aside from the benefits arising from a deeper understanding of the conceptual similarities and differences among these information communities, several major outcomes are envisaged in terms of computational infrastructure. Specifically, the investigators will conduct research and development leading to (1) computational tools to mediate the interoperation (sharing) of data among disparate communities of scientists, focusing broadly on geospatial disciplines; (2) computational tools with which to construct, represent, store, and exchange ontologies generated from disparate information communities; (3) computational tools to visualize and explore ontologies and to support the human-centered sharing of understanding between information communities; and (4) measures to quantify ontological differences between specific entities and categories, and between entire ontologies, as a measure of the complexity and likely success of interoperation.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research project tackles a common problem that pervades the geospatial sciences - how to share information and results of analyses among communities of scientists in a way that takes account of the different ways in which those communities conceptualize the world (or parts thereof). The specific focus of this project is on better sharing of information and computational models among environmental scientists, ecologists and epidemiologists, with a specific focus on human health outcomes. Certain infectious diseases have a complex relationship with the environment. Changes in climate and land cover offer new habitats for disease-carrying organisms and their hosts that can cause harm to humans (exemplified by West Nile Virus and Lyme Disease). By improving the sharing of models and data relating to climate and climate change, host and vector life cycles, land use and land-use change, human demographics, and human health, scientists and policy makers will be better able to understand the problem in greater detail, plan for future outbreaks based on changes to the status quo, develop mitigation strategies more effectively, and inform and educate health practitioners and the general public to increase awareness.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Collaborative grants are awarded to the University of South Dakota and the University of North Carolina to develop ontology-driven tools for machine reasoning over large volumes of phenotype data. Human-readable descriptions of &amp;quot;phenotypic&amp;quot; properties such as anatomy and behavior are not well-suited to computational analysis. Yet, in evolutionary biology, genetics and development, computational assistance is necessary to discover patterns within the enormous volumes of descriptive phenotype data that are being reported in the literature and in online databases. Ontologies are structured, controlled vocabularies that can be applied to collections of descriptive data to permit logical reasoning to be used. Using the evolutionary transition from fins to limbs as a test system, this project will develop ontologically-aware software that allows users to discover similar sets of phenotypes for different taxa or mutant genes within large and diverse datasets. A fast semantic similarity engine will be developed to allow searches for evolutionary transitions and mutant genes characterized by similar phenotypic profiles. An ontological framework for reasoning over homology will be developed to allow rigorous reasoning over evolutionary diverse lineages. Natural language processing tools will be developed to improve upon the efficiency of mining phenotype data from the literature and improving data consistency. This suite of tools will be tested on a large number of skeletal phenotypes from diverse fossil and modern vertebrates.

The ontologies and software tools, together with phenotypes extracted from the vertebrate systematic literature, will be integrated in the knowledgebase with genetic and phenotype data from three vertebrate model organisms: zebrafish (Danio rerio), African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), and mouse (Mus musculus).

<Abstract>The life science research community generates an abundance of data on genes, proteins, sequences, etc. These are captured in publicly available resources such as Entrez Gene, PDB and PubMed and in focused collections such as TAIR and OMIM. A number of ontologies such as GO, PO and UMLS are in use to increase interoperability. Records in these resources are typically annotated with controlled vocabulary (CV) terms from one or more ontologies. Records are often hyperlinked to those in other repositories, creating a richly curated biological Web of semantic knowledge. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The objective of this project is to develop tools to explore and mine this rich Web of annotated and hyperlinked entries so as to discover meaningful patterns.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The approach builds upon finding potentially meaningful and novel associations between pairs of CV terms cross multiple ontologies. The bridge of associations across ontologies reflects annotation practices across repositories. A variety of graph data mining and network analysis techniques are being explored to find complex patterns of groups of CV terms cross multiple ontologies. The intent is to identify biologically meaningful associations that yield nuggets of actionable knowledge to be made available to the scientist together with a set of golden publications that support the identified patterns.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The intellectual merit of the project is that it is unique in comparison to other bioinformatics data integration and analysis projects. Data is integrated from across numerous sources including genes, gene annotations, ontologies, and the literature. The exploratory nature (EAGER) of this research is both with respect to the biological and the computer science disciplines. From the biological viewpoint, a high level of speculation is associated with any discovered biological patterns. Discovered patterns night not necessarily meet criteria for experimental validation. The research methodology combines algorithmic and analytical techniques from multiple computer science sub-disciplines. While specific technical innovations are expected, an inter-related set of computer science challenges needs to be defined.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research has the potential for broader impact since the methodology can be applied to any type of interlinked resources on the biological semantic Web as well as to any collection of hyperlinked resources. This research is a collaboration between the University of Maryland and the University of Iowa.

<Abstract>Collaborative grants are awarded to the University of South Dakota and the University of North Carolina to develop ontology-driven tools for machine reasoning over large volumes of phenotype data. Human-readable descriptions of &amp;quot;phenotypic&amp;quot; properties such as anatomy and behavior are not well-suited to computational analysis. Yet, in evolutionary biology, genetics and development, computational assistance is necessary to discover patterns within the enormous volumes of descriptive phenotype data that are being reported in the literature and in online databases. Ontologies are structured, controlled vocabularies that can be applied to collections of descriptive data to permit logical reasoning to be used. Using the evolutionary transition from fins to limbs as a test system, this project will develop ontologically-aware software that allows users to discover similar sets of phenotypes for different taxa or mutant genes within large and diverse datasets. A fast semantic similarity engine will be developed to allow searches for evolutionary transitions and mutant genes characterized by similar phenotypic profiles. An ontological framework for reasoning over homology will be developed to allow rigorous reasoning over evolutionary diverse lineages. Natural language processing tools will be developed to improve upon the efficiency of mining phenotype data from the literature and improving data consistency. This suite of tools will be tested on a large number of skeletal phenotypes from diverse fossil and modern vertebrates. Taxonomic and anatomical ontologies for vertebrates will be augmented and hypotheses of anatomical homology formally encoded. The ontologies and software tools, together with phenotypes extracted from the vertebrate systematic literature, will be integrated in the knowledgebase with genetic and phenotype data from three vertebrate model organisms: zebrafish (Danio rerio), African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), and mouse (Mus musculus). The knowledge base will be exposed to generic reasoners using semantic web standards.

<Abstract>&amp;quot;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Indiana University is awarded a grant to expand and improve a publicly accessible Database of Protein (http://www.DisProt.org). This database now contains sequence and functional information for ~ 500 protein entries that have more than 1000 experimentally characterized regions of intrinsic disorder. The work to be funded will greatly expand the number of proteins in this database, will enlarge the array of information for the various proteins, will improve the features and usability of this database, will discover new functions associated with disordered proteins and regions, and will begin the development of an ontology for intrinsically disordered protein. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intrinsically disordered proteins carry out a wide variety of functions. A recent bioinformatics study suggests that, at a minimum, ~ 1/3 of protein-associated functions depend on protein disorder. These disorder-dependent functions underlie critical cellular processes such as gene regulation, cell division, organization of protein-protein interaction networks, formation and regulation of function-determining signaling pathways, and so on. Development of the DisProt Database will confirm that many particular biological functions suspected to depend on protein disorder actually do depend on disorder, will show the generality of many particular disorder examples, will lead to the discovery of new examples of disorder-dependent biological functions, and will provide for the first time a comprehensive evaluation of the roles of disorder in the cell. A central repository of information on intrinsically disordered proteins has the potential of transforming the entire fields of cellular, molecular, chemical, and systems biology; biochemistry; and biophysics by revealing the common and critical dependence on protein disorder for a wide variety of fundamentally important biological processes.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Award: 0955935&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI: Theresa A. Pardo&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Title: INTEROP: Building Information Sharing Networks to Support Consumer Choice (I-Choose)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Most products consumed within the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) are produced and distributed through low cost supply chains that typically do not reveal certain types of information to end consumers. Without this information it is difficult for consumers to assess the quality of the products they buy or exercise their preferences for safe, environmentally sustainable, and economically just products and services. Producers also have much less of an incentive to provide such goods without an effective, trustworthy way to inform consumers. In order to provide full information about how, when, and by whom manufactured goods were produced, the producers, supply chain operators, and third party certifiers will need to agree on a data architecture that can facilitate exchange and sharing of information that comes from production systems, supply chain distribution systems, and systems used to determine compliance with voluntary and government-mandated product standards. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will create I-Choose; a data interoperability framework to support the provision of a wide range of information about how, where, and by whom commodities are manufactured and brought to market. This includes information about ?green? supply chains, production methods, wages paid to producers or workers in the supply chain, working conditions, environmental impact, and a wide range of other information about the products can be delivered to consumers. A data architecture designed to enable interoperability will be generated through a multi-stage iterative process of sequential consensus building activities. These activities will include the stakeholders involved in Mexican coffee production for distribution in Canada and the US, along with researchers from the fields of information science, computer science, economics, and political science. We will explore interoperability with three types of specific information systems: (1) Those designed and maintained by government regulators, (2) Those designed and maintained by consumer advocates using social networking technologies, and (3) proprietary data systems from individual firms in the producer, supply chain, or retail systems. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The I-Choose data interoperability network will be unprecedented in nature as it will involve consumers, producers, government regulatory agencies and supply chain/distribution across multiple domains and countries. It will allow more information into market transactions allowing consumers more informed decision-making that maximize their specific utility preferences and align the strategies of these stakeholder groups through market mechanisms rather than through cumbersome regulation. These diverse stakeholders will collaborate to create a series of technical products of the increasing granularity and specificity (ontology, taxonomy, data architecture) necessary for supporting interoperability while gradually expanding their network. The result of this process will be a fully-formed research and practice network and a high quality set of deliverables produced through the consensus of all relevant stakeholder groups, thus ensuring maximum interoperability of information systems. The knowledge gained through constructing and expanding I-Choose will inform a wide range of future collaborations in terms of how to create a trusted environment where incentives for collaboration and competition are complementary, not mutually exclusive. The study is relevant for a wide range of actors who are already experimenting with new forms of collaboration such as labor, environment, and agriculture departments and agencies in the NAFTA region, interested legislators, businesses, trade unions, environmental NGOs, consumer groups, and agricultural associations.</Abstract>

<Abstract>EIA-0131912&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Beard-Tisdale, Mary-Kate&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;University of Maine&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;BDEI: Event and process tagging for information integration for the International Gulf of Maine Watershed&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Project Summary&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This incubation proposal addresses the issue of integrating large, diverse, and autonomous&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;collections of scientific data within a complex institutional setting. The goal is to convert these&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;autonomous collections into a shareable repository that supports synthesis of data through new&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;metadata structures based on events and processes. The institutional setting is the data and data-&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;gathering activities of over 80 agencies, NGOS, and academic and research institutions operating&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;within the Gulf of Maine watershed. The metadata development will be coordinated by library and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;spatial information scientists working jointly with domain scientists. An essential task of this&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;incubation effort will be the development of a shared understanding of environmental processes and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;events that becomes a shareable ontology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Libraries play a vital role in organizing intellectual access to creative works. Scientific data has&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tended to be outside this traditional purview and has thus lacked the benefits of cataloging and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;indexing that promote shared access. We are proposing a new metadata structure that exploits&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;common units of analysis in environmental studies: events and processes. Associating scientific data&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;sets with event and process tags, in addition to other metadata elements, can substantially improve&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the ability to integrate and synthesize diverse scientific collections. The metadata initiative of this&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;proposal will lay the foundation for specifying events and processes through the collaboration of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;data collections content specialists and information management specialists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A large percentage of vaulable geoscience data is based on the analysis of discrete samples and is collected manually (e.g., paleontological collections, structural/tectonic data, petrographic/mineralogic data, economic data, geochemical measurements, rock mechanics, etc.) Often, these data are reported only in tables in the published literature or in .pdf or spreadsheets on individual investigator websites. Commonly these data are not registerd on or entered into standardized, publicly accessible databases. As a result, for this data to be discovered and used/reused, researchers or other interested parties must manually comb through the text, figures, and appendices of journal articles or websites of individual investigators, sometimes having to sift through raw experimental data. This process is extremely time intensive and slows down the time needed to make scientific discoveries or allow verification of research results. As a result the vast amount of surface earth geoscience data is currently inaccessible. This inaccessible data is termed &amp;quot;Dark Data&amp;quot;. This EAGER combines the expertise of top-notch computer scientists and geoscientists whose goal is to create a search algorithm to bring this dark data to light in a way that will enable the next generation of integrative geoscience research. The approach will involved development of an innovative search engine &amp;quot;crawler&amp;quot; that will comb the geoscience literature and bring dark data to light from the text and figures in this corpus. The cyberinfrastructure tool being developed will be able to interpret the semantics of English text and the concepts of geoscience. The tool will be piloted by examining entries on the Macrostrat database, a structured spatial database of lithologic and geochronologic information, and then employing a geoscience ontology by means of the Hazy framework for information extraction. Questions to be addressed will be to find out to what extent dark data is presently accessible and if it can be extracted and placed into an accessible format and repository where it can be discovered by web services or other search engines. Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and increasing the infrastructure for science through the development of a new and much needed data search tool.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research will develop a cyberinfrastructure middleware (CINET) to support Network Science. The National Research Council defines Network Science as ``the study of network representations of physical, biological, and social phenomena leading to predictive models of these phenomena.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; CINET will provide researchers, analysts and educators interested in Network Science with an easy-to-use cyber-environment that is accessible from their desktop and integrates into their daily work. CINET will expand the size of networks that are routinely studied from hundreds or thousands of nodes to hundreds of millions of nodes. It will foster multi-disciplinary and multi-university research and teaching collaborations, including disciplines such as social sciences that traditionally have not used high performance computing resources.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;CINET will be pervasive, flexible and extensible. Users can contribute new networks, data, methods, hardware, and research results in an integrative way. Advanced users can expand CINET by adding new tools, user interfaces, recommendation engines, digital library features, or other desired functionality. End users will be insulated from the complexities of resource allocation, scheduling,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;cross-platform interactions, and other detailed computing considerations. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;CINET will enable new ways by which researchers study and teach complex networks. It will enable educators to harness high performance computing technologies to teach Network Science to students spanning various academic levels, disciplines and institutions. The educational plan includes high school students to Ph.D. candidates, students from minority and under-represented groups, and students at smaller institutions that often do not have easy access to HPC resources. Education material will be disseminated widely through the Ensemble pathways project in NSF&amp;apos;s educational digital library, NSDL.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Palmer, Antarctica, Long-Term Ecological Research Project (PAL) seeks to understand the structure and function of the Western Antarctic Peninsula&amp;apos;s marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the context of seasonal-to-interannual atmospheric and sea ice dynamics, as well as long-term climate change. The PAL measurement system (or grid) is designed to study marine and terrestrial food webs consisting principally of diatom primary producers, the dominant herbivore Antarctic krill, and the apex predator Adelie penguin. An attenuated microbial food web is also a focus. PAL studies these ecosystems annually over a regional scale grid of oceanographic stations and seasonally at Palmer Station. Sea ice extent and variability affects ecosystem changes at all trophic levels. In recent years, sea ice extent has diminished in response to a general warming in the region. Long-term population trends of ice-dependent Adelie penguins in the region provide a clear example of impact of the climate warming trend in the in the region. Adelie populations at the five major colonies studied near Palmer Station have all shown a gradual decrease in numbers over thirty years. The Peninsula runs perpendicular to a strong climatic gradient between the cold, dry continental regime to the south, characteristic of the Antarctic interior, and the warm, moist, maritime regime to the north. North-south shifts in the gradient give rise to large environmental variability to climate change. Currently more maritime conditions appear to be replacing the original polar ecosystem in the northern part of the peninsula as the climatic gradient shifts southward. To date, this shift appears matched by an ecosystem shift along the peninsula, as evidenced by declines in Adelie populations that require longer snow-cover seasons for successful recruitment. The main hypothesis is that ecosystem migration is most clearly manifested by changes in upper level predators (penguins) and certain polar fishes in predator foraging environments. This is because these longer lived species integrate recent climate trends and because individual species are more sensitive indicators than aggregated functional groups. Analogous modifications are expected to be manifested at lower trophic levels in the marine parts of the system in the years ahead. However, these lower level changes are likely to be observed only through long-term observations consistent with the concept of expansion and contraction of ecosystem boundaries along the Peninsula. The PAL-LTER will continue to investigate ecosystem changes at lower trophic levels along the Peninsula, in response to the continued, dramatic climate warming and pole ward shifts in the climatic gradient. In addition to the long-term research activities, graduate student training, the involvement of K-12 teachers and web-based education are an integral part of the PAL-LTER.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Crocodylia (alligators, gharials, and crocodiles) is one of the major extant reptilian clades. Therefore,a basic grasp of the structure and function of crocodilian genomes is essential to developing a comprehensive understanding of genome evolution, structure, and function in amniotes. Furthermore, because the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, their genomes represent the best group through which we can gain an outside perspective on avian genome evolution and function. To facilitate comparative genomics and the testing of a variety of hypotheses involving Crocodylia and other amniotes including birds and mammals, this research focuses on (1) investigating crocodilian genome diversity and evolution through detailed analysis of mobile elements (MEs), and (2) providing fundamental information about genome organization, gene synteny and regulatory sequences in three crocodilian species. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of molecular and computational tools, including BAC library construction and analysis, Cot library construction and analysis, and structure/function analyses of the resulting data via GBrowse and GO (Gene Ontology) annotation. The research will complement and enhance international efforts to understand the genetic underpinnings of genome structure and function by illuminating the impact of mobile elements on genome structure and function in a critical amniote lineage and by providing information on important developmental genes and conserved non-coding elements in the lineage.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research will serve as a focal point for local high school teachers to experience current research in molecular biology and evolution through integration into a functional research laboratory. The teachers will then be helped in incorporating their new knowledge and experiences into their teaching for the benefit of their students. The research will also be part of ongoing collaborative partnerships between Mississippi State University and student researchers from local historically black colleges and universities. Finally, these efforts will inform general aspects of evolution and genomics and highlight crocodilians, organisms of broad public interest. The use of these charismatic megafauna will enhance the public&amp;apos;s interest in evolution and genome biology, along with its understanding of both.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A relatively small number of universal data types are used as basic building blocks in programming languages corresponding to a few well tested mathematical abstractions. This project is about structuring equivalences between them as bijective data type transformations connecting computational objects widely used by computer scientists and mathematicians, like sequences, sets, trees, logic circuits, graphs. An implementation of these transformations will be built in the form of an open source Data Transformation Library. It is also planned to make available the software in the form of a Java applet and a Mathematica notebook, having as broader impact various teaching applications and support for experimenting with data transformations in an intuitive, visual framework.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI&amp;apos;s recent work has showed that these bijections can be organized naturally as a finite groupoid with objects provided by the data types and morphisms provided by their transformations. The project plans to extend these encodings into a comprehensive data transformation framework providing a uniform view of the basic building blocks of various computational artifacts. It also plans exploring the transfer between data types of inductive definitions of their fundamental operations, opening the possibility to derive interesting new algorithms. As a proof of concept, algorithms performing arbitrary size arithmetic computations using symbolic representations like trees or graphs will be obtained. In a broader sense, the project is likely to bring significant simplifications to the ontology shared by computer science and engineering fields, resulting in better communication and synergy between them.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)award is to explore, characterize, and map the use of user-centric design methods and tools. TheDesignExchange will provide a mechanism for investigators to answer questions pertaining to the motivation for the choice of and use of a particular design method for a design problem. TheDesignExchange will offer a centralized venue where human-centered design methods will be shared, discussed and disseminated, so that the research community can then engage in research to provide explanations as to how the various methods within the design process relate to each other. TheDesignExchange will increase researchers&amp;apos; understanding of structured design processes, and will also be an invaluable resource to train novice and professional engineers and designers.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the outcomes of this award will result in an interactive web portal to facilitate the capture, analysis and widespread use of human-centered design methods, together with the insights as to how these methods will be best used for maximum success of the design venture. TheDesignExchange will be powered by a multidisciplinary community contributed database, which will allow practitioners and researchers to more deeply understand the use of design methods in practice and will facilitate the exchange of information between industry and academia. A workshop will be held in conjunction with this work at the 2012 NSF CMMI Grantees Conference. The outcomes of this workshop will form the basis of the research agenda for TheDesignExchange platform, including hypotheses for an ontology that maps human-centered design methods to real-world design problems, which will be made available to both industry and the research community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A large percentage of vaulable geoscience data is based on the analysis of discrete samples and is collected manually (e.g., paleontological collections, structural/tectonic data, petrographic/mineralogic data, economic data, geochemical measurements, rock mechanics, etc.) Often, these data are reported only in tables in the published literature or in .pdf or spreadsheets on individual investigator websites. Commonly these data are not registerd on or entered into standardized, publicly accessible databases. As a result, for this data to be discovered and used/reused, researchers or other interested parties must manually comb through the text, figures, and appendices of journal articles or websites of individual investigators, sometimes having to sift through raw experimental data. This process is extremely time intensive and slows down the time needed to make scientific discoveries or allow verification of research results. As a result the vast amount of surface earth geoscience data is currently inaccessible. This inaccessible data is termed &amp;quot;Dark Data&amp;quot;. This EAGER combines the expertise of top-notch computer scientists and geoscientists whose goal is to create a search algorithm to bring this dark data to light in a way that will enable the next generation of integrative geoscience research. The approach will involved development of an innovative search engine &amp;quot;crawler&amp;quot; that will comb the geoscience literature and bring dark data to light from the text and figures in this corpus. The cyberinfrastructure tool being developed will be able to interpret the semantics of English text and the concepts of geoscience. The tool will be piloted by examining entries on the Macrostrat database, a structured spatial database of lithologic and geochronologic information, and then employing a geoscience ontology by means of the Hazy framework for information extraction. Questions to be addressed will be to find out to what extent dark data is presently accessible and if it can be extracted and placed into an accessible format and repository where it can be discovered by web services or other search engines. Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and increasing the infrastructure for science through the development of a new and much needed data search tool.</Abstract>

They will build on an existing wide base of support, as evidenced by the attached letters, and provide community-backed leadership toward solving the major metadata challenges in oceanographic science.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The MMI activities are a critical component of an overall strategy to provide potential users of marine data the capability to find and utilize the data they require. To NSF, MMI contributes towards providing the ability to find and more fully exploit ocean observations supported through NSF. The purpose of this proposed effort is not to develop the physical infrastructure needed to improve our ability to access, understand and use marine data, the proposed tools (both program oriented and Web-based), documentation, and outreach and training activities will provide for the enhancement of scientific and technological understanding. A program such as the MMI could potentially be an impetus towards facilitating integration across ocean, coastal and estuarine observing domains, although this will take continued funding past two year.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Commercial data providers have exploited open sources such as published telephone directories, property transactions, and bankruptcy filings for years. However, recent concerns and legislation related to privacy have caused many sources to redact attributes that provide explicit entity identification, e.g., removing street number and name from the address, using only the last four digits of the security number.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Adding to the challenge are semi-structured and unstructured sources such as narrative event notices, e.g., obituary, birth, marriage, divorce. These sources typically have complete names, but provide even fewer address clues, in some cases only naming the city of last residence or the city where the event occurred. These kinds of Partially Redacted Open Sources (PROS) are difficult to automate for several reasons:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- The documents do not explicitly state all of the attributes defining a unique identity&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- The documents are often in semi-structured or unstructured text formats that complicate attribute extraction&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Knowledge management is difficult because each type of PROS has a different semantic ontology often with many possible terms even though each instance is sparsely populated Despite these challenges, PROS can be data rich, providing important supplementary entity information. For example, an obituary may give a complete set of family relationships to the decedent including parents, children, and siblings.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The primary nature of the proposed research is to investigate and develop effective methods and techniques for resolving the identity of entities appearing PROS. The primary objective of the project will be to improve and extend the methods and techniques developed in previous research for the specific case of identification of individuals in online obituary notices [1, 2] and multi-agency entity resolution [3], and demonstrate that these same methods and techniques can be effective when applied to other types of PROS.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The anticipated output of the research is a set of technical papers documenting in detail the methods and techniques developed in the project and assessments of their effectiveness in various PROS contexts. Where appropriate, software prototypes developed as part of the project will be included as part of the project deliverables.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A domain-independent knowledge-based framework is being developed, specific to the task of abstraction of higher-level, interval-based concepts from time-stamped data in a context- sensitive manner. The inference structure used is knowledge- based temporal-abstraction, which decomposes the temporal- abstraction task into five subtasks, each solved by a temporal- abstraction mechanism. The research provides a formal method for specification of temporal-abstraction knowledge and for facilitating its acquisition, maintenance, reuse, and sharing. A representation of the knowledge in the web-based Ontolingua language also is evaluated. The temporal-abstraction mechanisms are being extended and validated within the RESUME system. An automated graphical tool for acquiring temporal-abstraction knowledge is developed using the PROTEGE-II system. An evaluation is being performed of the knowledge-acquisition tool, the computational mechanisms, and the overall framework in the diabetes-therapy domain and within the EON architecture for guideline-based care. The research has implications for construction of knowledge-based planning and monitoring systems in time-oriented domains, for automated summarization of temporal databases, for the operational semantics of deductive temporal databases, and for the semantics of queries to temporal databases; preliminary evaluation in clinical and engineering domains is highly encouraging.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Biological systems are the product of an evolutionary process of random tinkering and selection that resulted in unexpected and non-intuitive ?engineering? solutions to dynamically varying conditions. Thus, biological systems are robust, adaptive and evolvable information processing systems that operate asynchronously and in parallel on multiple scales. The examination and characterization of the design principles of biological circuits has the potential to revolutionize biology, medicine and the way computing and communication systems are built. This project is pioneering important advances at the interface between biology and computation by pursuing two complementary goals: (1) to develop a modular, parallel-ready simulator to replicate the multi-scalar architecture of complex biological systems; (2) to discover key design principles relevant to information processing systems in general by reproducing biological design in silico. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Information processing by cells encompasses multiple scales connecting molecular events to phenotypes. Current simulation techniques have limited multi-scale and modular capabilities, resulting in models that describe only a single feature of a given system and miss the relationships between architecture, function and behavior. This research effort addresses these limitations by representing biological systems as a hierarchy of functional executable modules. The design of the platform obeys four basic principles: 1) components are objects; 2) objects are governed by rules; 3) rules include some degree of stochasticity; and 4) objects and rules are organized in functional and spatial modules that compose a hierarchy. The development of the new platform is driven by the construction of simulations of key biological model systems with an unprecedented scope and precision, such as bacterial chemotaxis, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, the acute inflammatory response, and parallel processing by bacterial colonies. The reproduction of these biological systems in silico is providing insights into their design principles, which in turn advances the future design and implementation of distributed technological systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores an approach to document indexing and search, which replaces conventional keywords with &amp;quot;concept terms&amp;quot; from a linguistically and semantically rich ontology. Its direct research objectives will be to determine whether the use of such a rich descriptive language can allow non-experts (i.e., non-archivists/librarians) to effectively annotate media resources (especially non-textual media) with &amp;quot;concept terms&amp;quot; which usefully improve both the precision and recall of subsequent searches. The research will prototype technologies and practices that enable semi-skilled workers (drawn from ethnically and economically diverse neighborhoods) to usefully and easily describe content using a conceptual language. The results of this process will be evaluated as to the accuracy of the annotations and their effectiveness in guiding browsing and search. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Enabling non-experts (especially content producers) to improve the quality of searches, that is, to create rich and useful metadata, will make the publication and sharing of content more effective and useful. This could be a useful resource for the research community. In addition, the development of the proffered technology may also mean that language technologies can be deployed by enabling a new segment of the work force to perform the important task of concept annotation. Thus, supporting the creation of new semi-skilled entry-level positions in metadata production may broaden the impact of the new economy.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a proof-of-concept, multi-modal Universal Access Web Interface that provides the user with a choice between text, speech, and animated American Sign Language (ASL). A representative knowledgebase, encoded using Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema, will be translated into differentiated representations in Vcom3D&amp;apos;s Character Animation Markup Language (CAML). CAML, developed under a previous NSF SBIR grant, is currently being used in several educational products and on Websites (including www.signingavatar.com) to create grammatically correct ASL, as well as synthesized speech with correct prosody and coordinated gesture and expression. The effectiveness of the proof-of-concept Universal Access Web Interface in K-12 educational environments will be tested. Based on successful demonstrations of the proof-of-concept , the extensibility of the Interface to more general knowledgebase domains will be examined. In particular, the investigative team will evaluate the applicability of Resource Description Framework (RDF), Ontology Web Language (OWL), and other Semantic Web initiatives to the creation of a standards-based Accessible Semantic Web. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The project has potential to produce in Software Tools that can be used to economically create e-Learning materials that are accessible to both deaf and blind persons. Longer-term development, in concert with the emergence of the Semantic Web, can result in products that provide general accessibility to Web-based information in multiple language modalities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The central question which motivates Professor Goodman&amp;apos;s study is what is the nature of mathematical reality. Professor Goodman is seeking in his research to develop a philosophy of mathematics which embodies the central insights of both the classical and the constructive traditions. Such a philosophy would be &amp;quot;Platonistic&amp;quot; in its ontology but constructivist in its epistemology. He found a way to accomplish this goal by using Lewis&amp;apos; &amp;quot;S4&amp;quot; semantics as the underlying logic which allowed for a reconciliation of the classical and intuitionistic positions. Under this grant, Professor Goodman will fill in his argument for the classical mathematical realism from the &amp;quot;hardness&amp;quot; and objectivity of mathematical statements and the empirical verifiability of their consequences. He will argue that experience with these features of mathematics allows us to move from assertability conditions to truth conditions, but that assertability conditions still play an indispensable role in the semantics of irreducibly intentional parts of mathematics. Using epistemic theories which Professor Goodman interprets as combining truth and assertability conditions, he will attempt a systematic account of actual mathematical discourse. This research project combines Professor Goodman&amp;apos;s deep understanding of mathematics with subtle philosophical analysis. His prior work clearly demonstrates his ability to present clear, well-organized and provocative arguments for his positions. His study promises to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the nature of mathematical realism and its implication in ordinary mathematical language as it is found in textbooks, monographs and journals.</Abstract>

<Abstract>University of Florida doctoral candidate, Alan Schultz, supervised by Dr. Clarence Gravlee, will undertake research on the relationship between stress and socio-cultural change. The research will be carried out among a group of foraging-farmers, the Tsimane&amp;apos; of lowland Bolivia, who are at an early stage of exposure to markets and non-traditional cultures. The researcher will try to solve the puzzle of why Tsimane&amp;apos; have some of the lowest known rates of short-term stress biomarkers and related adverse health outcomes despite two decades of increasing market exposure, which is usually associated with increased stress and worsening health. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The study will take up these topics using a variety of social science methods, including long-term participant observation focused on local experiences and interpretations of market exposure and social stratification. Key points of focus are the psychosocial stress pathway and culture&amp;apos;s role in shifts of the balance between stressors and resistive resources. Structured ethnography will be used to isolate cultural models of social status, social relations and material lifestyle. The project culminates in an epidemiologic survey that tests individual beliefs and behavior against shared ideals linking these to the stress process and outcomes such as blood pressure and a retrospective stress biomarker, hair cortisol. The project also includes an innovative investigation of the impact of local ontology on the effects of market integration and an examination of the impacts of the local research economy that has resulted from the fact that as one of the world&amp;apos;s last relatively isolated populations, the Tsimane&amp;apos; have hosted researchers for decades.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research is innovative because it links culture and meaning to individual biological and health outcomes in a population that has so far remained resistant to chronic stress and related poor health. More generally, isolation of the roles that culture and meaning have played in limiting chronic stress during market exposure will suggest alternative areas of inquiry on chronic stress in other populations. Supporting the research also supports the education of a graduate student.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Understanding and analyzing the way our world is connected is a critical but new challenge in today&amp;apos;s world, thanks to the technological advances of personal computers, mobile devices, as well as local and global Internet connections. Most current methods in the area of social media analysis, inference and understanding are based on textual data. However, the image data makes an increasingly large proportion of data in social media. Hence, there is an urgent need for tools that can effectively use image data to extract important information to infer patterns and activities of people, communities and society at large. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project combines advances in computer vision, machine learning, and social networks in novel ways for understanding and analyzing large-scale social media data. The proposal brings together computer vision and machine learning research in novel ways to develop new methods for analyzing large-scale social media data. It pursues 4 inter-related aims: (i) Establishing a large-scale visual concept ontology and structures for the web-image world via crowdsourcing, taxonomy induction, and nonparametric learning methods; (ii) Understanding activity in social networks by analyzing image contents in the context of social media in large-scale and with connectivity; (iii) Inferring the structure of social networks and communities from image contents and activity of individuals in social networks; (iv) Discovering and analyzing dynamic social media trends. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Anticipated products of this research include new tools for analysis and modeling of socially generated content, with special emphasis on image data. The resulting methods provide potentially useful insights that characterize users, communities and societies, in a broad range of applications. The project offers enhanced research-based advanced training opportunities for graduate as well as undergraduate students and involves development of new courses on related topics at both Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award provides partial support for the first International BioCurator Meeting (IBCM), to be held on December 8-11, 2005 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, CA. The overall objective of this conference is to bring together the diverse group of scientists worldwide who create and maintain the content of the biological databases so vital to modern biomedical and biological research. The majority of the audience will be database curators and curator assistants. Database curators are typically scientists with Ph.D. in biology or a related field, often with some years of post-doctoral research experience. Curator assistants are typically graduate undergraduate students, or recent graduates with a B.A. or M.A. in biology or a related field. We also expect participation by projects heads (professors, project managers, lead scientists), postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and database and software developers. The conference will convene over a period of two and a half days and will consist of daytime oral sessions and evening poster sessions covering four major topics: literature curation and collection, genome sequence annotation and comparative genomics, ontology development, and curation of large-scale functional genomics data. Oral sessions will include three hour-long plenary lectures and 20 shorter talks (20 or 30 minutes each). Twelve of the shorter talks will be given by invited speakers, and the remainder will be chosen from the abstracts submitted. There will be a moderated discussion session at the end of each day. The poster sessions will be dedicated to developments in curation tools, techniques, and quality control, and will also include demonstrations of informatics resources. The objectives for this meeting are to stimulate communication within the biocurator community in order to enhance the quality of these database resources, and to promote the recognition of biological curation as a profession. As the sheer volume of biological information increases exponentially, the importance of databases in keeping it organized and easily accessible to the entire international research community also increases. Thus although the direct audience for this meeting may be currently composed of several hundred people, the implications of this meeting for improved curation and integration of biological data reach to the entire international biomedical and biological research community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (STTR) Phase II project as a continuation of the Phase I effort, will develop alpha versions of the Regulatory Knowledge Base (RKB) products. The Regulatory Knowledge Bases will be tailored to classes of compliance problems within the financial services space, such as broker or trading compliance, or anti-money laundering. Addtiionally, they will include a complex regulatory ontology specific to the financial services industry and rule bases that reflect the latest regulations and best practices that govern analysis of alerts and compliance cases. The Regulatory Knowledge Base products will be sold in various formats and standards so they can be directly deployed on various commercial off-the-shelf reasoning engines. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Regulatory demands, as well as the increasing costs associated with financial crime, are placing increasing cost pressures on financial institutions. The burden of compliance is driving up operational costs. Financial services firms are seeking to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and return on investment of their compliance and risk management systems. The current knowledge management technologies and software tools cannot offer efficient customized procedures to deal with specific compliance cases. Therefore, there is a need for flexible knowledge-based systems, like Disciple-FS, and for Regulatory Knowledge Base products, that can offer help in solving specific cases while ensuring compliance with all the rules and regulations. These systems should also be capable of acquiring reasoning skills of their users to adapt their capabilities to deal with new cases. The prototype built during Phase I proved that the Disciple Technologies have the required functions and abilities to support development, utilization, and maintenance of regulatory knowledge bases. The prototype also helped to identify research and development goals for Phase II that we present in this proposal.</Abstract>

<Abstract>In 2000, the international collaboration entitled the &amp;quot;Long-range Plan for the Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis thaliana Genome Research Project&amp;quot; concluded successfully with the release of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence. This marked the release of the first complete plant genome sequence and provided a wealth of new information to facilitate both basic research in Arabidopsis and translational approaches in other species. In order to leverage this new resource, the Multinational Arabidopsis thaliana Functional Genomics Project was initiated in 2001 with the primary goal of determining a function for every Arabidopsis gene by the year 2010. The Project is coordinated by the MASC (Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee) which coordinates Arabidopsis functional genomics research activities taking place throughout the world and ensures a high level of international cooperation. The MASC comprises volunteer scientists representing various nations with active Arabidopsis functional research activities. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Since 2002, a full-time coordinator has been employed to assist the MASC (and the North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee, NAASC) and facilitate progress on the goals and objectives of the Functional Genomics Project. This award provides funding to support the MASC Coordinator for two more years. The specific duties of the coordinator include: (1) Function as the Coordinator and Executive Secretary for the MASC and the NAASC, (2) Together with TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) update, maintain, and expand the MASC websites to inform the research community about various large-scale activities (e.g. mutant collections, genome annotation and ontology improvements, proteome, metabolome, systems biology approaches, etc.), (3) Help organize and secure support for the annual Arabidopsis research conference (held in the U.S./North America for two out of every three years), (4) Serve as the production editor for the annual MASC progress report and other documents that the MASC produces, and (5) Perform outreach activities and act as a contact point between various public and private funding agencies, the MASC, the NAASC, and the research community.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: The Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Project has been a model of international research collaboration characterized by open sharing of information, data and research materials. The MASC has played a key role in the success of the Project. The MASC Coordinator will contribute to the continued success of the Project which will be ultimately measured by the community reaching the goal of identifying the function of all Arabidopsis genes by the year 2010. Establishment and maintenance of functional genomics webpages hosted at TAIR and production and dissemination of the annual MASC report informs the community and the public about ongoing functional genomics projects in the Arabidopsis field. The internet resources enabled by the coordinator are made available for a broad user group including students, school teachers, and researchers in resource poor countries. The annual International Conference on Arabidopsis Research provides an important platform for the international Arabidopsis community to exchange vital information and highlight progress in the field. The Coordinator additionally performs outreach to under-represented minorities and scientists at Minority-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and 1890 Institutions to facilitate their participation in the annual Arabidopsis meetings.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Despite the success of the Internet, its bandwidth overprovisioning, redundancy in its connectivity, and increased understanding of operation, Internet users still experience congestion and service disruption. Furthermore, network applications are increasingly sophisticated requiring greater reliability and higher bandwidth. Particularly proliferation of high bandwidth one-to-many multimedia applications is imminent. Without effective network design schemes in place, users inevitably encounter occasional network service degradation or breakdowns. This research aims to design, implement, and evaluate network architecture for one-to-many high bandwidth applications through multiple layer perspectives toward achieving optimal resource usage, performance and reliability. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI will develop scalable and efficient algorithms of design and reconfiguration of virtual topologies for multicast while supporting unicast in optical layer; investigate the trade-off among overhead, scalability, and reliability in IP over optical network models; explore efficient multimedia delivery schemes particularly over multi-provider networks; and analyze multi-layer interaction and necessary cooperation for multicast applications. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The intellectual merit lies in taking a holistic multi-layer approach to large scale multicast support in the presence of unicast applications so as to address the optimization issues practically. The implicit or explicit cooperation of multiple layers provides new dimensions to network design for one-to-many high bandwidth applications. The developing of optimization algorithms and the quantifying the performance benefits of innovations are expected to have a wide applicability in computer science.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will broadly impact the universities, industry and research community in a number of ways by reaching out to students from underrepresented groups for the research projects, enhancing the quality of education by integrating the latest research developments into instructional activities of undergraduate and graduate curriculum, and making project results available widely.</Abstract>

It is common to find curricula in the arts (music, graphical design), business (accounting, economics), sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), and social sciences with computational courses in their curriculum. In the one year of this project, the workshops will focus on identifying the scope of the similarities and differences among these communities and in identifying ways in which the computing community can best serve the entirety of the expanded community. The project will begin the integration of the computing ontology into the organization of curricular materials and the use of social software to deliver essential information. A centralized website will provide RSS feeds with news about computing education, blog entries about computing education, links to resources, and other community oriented information (e.g., conference calendars). Workshop participants will include faculty from all of the computing disciplines, industry representatives, students, and faculty from disciplines we do not usually think of as computing intensive.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The proposed project will apply some of the general principles of archiving and curation to digital data, with a focus on scientific data. The proposal calls for the development and refinement of a &amp;quot;staging process&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;that will bring an appropriate mix of human skills and automated tools to organize and initially describe a given corpus prior to incorporation into a repository. It assumes that for the foreseeable future some level of human judgement will be needed to adequately prepare and package a raw body of data. Outstanding questions to be addressed include whether a some point the level of human effort so high as to preclude further scaling.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed activity consists of two main parts: the design and deployment of a digital staging repository and the design and deployment of a metadata management architecture. The first encompasses issues of institutional policy, requirements analysis, and the selection and integration of existing software platforms (e.g., Fedora). The second will deal with complex metadata issues such as web semantics, ontology creation, and inter-domain cross-walking.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Language data is central to the research of a large social sciences community - not only linguists, but also anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, and sociologists interested in the culture of indigenous peoples. Members of this research community are currently faced with two urgent situations: the number of languages in the world is rapidly diminishing while the number of initiatives to create digital archives of language data is rapidly multiplying. The latter might seem to be an unalloyed good in the face of the former, but there are two ways things may go wrong without adequate collaboration among archivists, linguists, and language engineers. First, a common standard for the digitization of linguistic data may never be agreed upon. And the resulting variation in archiving practices and language representation would seriously inhibit data access, searching, and cross-linguistic comparison. Second, standards may be implemented without guidance from the people who best know the range of structural possibilities in human language-descriptive linguists who have done fieldwork on poorly described languages.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If digital archives of language data and documentation are to offer the widest possible access and to provide information in a maximally useful form, consensus must be reached about certain aspects of archive infrastructure. As the largest linguistic organization in the world and the central electronic publication of the discipline, The LINGUIST List &amp;lt;http://www.linguistlist.org&amp;gt; is organizing a collaborative project with a dual objective: (1) to preserve endangered languages data and documentation and (2) to aid in the development of infrastructure for linguistic archives. One outcome of the project will be a LINGUIST List digital archive housing data from 10 endangered languages. But the focus on infrastructure will produce other, equally important results. In the first place, The LINGUIST archive will function, not only as a repository, but also as a &amp;apos;showroom of best practice.&amp;apos; The archive will offer endangered languages data marked up and catalogued according to community consensus about best practice; furthermore, the archive will disseminate reference material delineating best practice and software tools supporting it. Another outcome will be the establishment on the LINGUIST List site of a central metadata server for the discipline; this server will organize information on all the language-related resources residing at distributed sites, not just endangered languages information alone. Other infrastructure-related outcomes include (1) the involvement of the linguistics community in establishing best practice, (2) the widespread dissemination of the resulting recommendations, and (3) the hands-on training of a substantial core of linguists and language archivists in the implementation of the guidelines. Although the data collection efforts will focus initially on endangered languages, the metadata server, the recommendations for best practice, and the distribution of supporting software will have a significant impact on all empirical research in linguistics. The project will thus add value to many other language-related projects currently planned or underway.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will result in the creation and distribution of a linguistically annotated version of an existing corpus of Japanese telephone conversations, the CallHome Japan (CHJ) corpus.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The CHJ corpus, released in 1996 by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), consists of digitized speech data and text transcriptions of 120 spontaneous, unscripted telephone conversations in Japanese. While the transcriptions are of high quality, the usefulness of the CHJ corpus for language research is limited by its lack of any syntactic, semantic, prosodic, or discourse annotations, including part-of-speech (POS) tags.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will address this deficiency by creating a new version of the CHJ corpus that includes useful POS, semantic and acoustic annotations. In particular, the following annotations will be provided for the entire corpus:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. POS tags, using the LDC&amp;apos;s inventory of 60 POS and morphological tags for Japanese;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Lexical semantic tags on verbs and nouns, using NTT&amp;apos;s 400,000-word Goi-Taikei semantic lexicon and ontology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The annotated corpus will be made available to the general research community through the normal channels of the Linguistic Data Consortium. This annotated corpus will stimulate and benefit research in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, Japanese linguistics, discourse and conversation analysis, variation (crosslinguistic, cross-cultural, and gender), and the prosody/syntax/semantics interfaces.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Digital identity management (DIM) has emerged as a critical foundation for supporting successful interactions in today&amp;apos;s globally interconnected society. It is crucial not only for the conduct of business and government but also for a large and growing body of electronic or online social interactions. In its broadest sense, identity management encompasses definitions and life-cycle management for digital identities and profiles, and the environments for exchanging and validating such information, including anonymous and pseudonymous representations. The project addresses a wide variety of digital identity needs by developing required Flexible, Multiple and Dependable Digital Identity (FMDDI) technology, based on a sound underlying set of definitions and principles. The FMDDI technology developed in the project will support multiple forms of identity, including nyms, partial identities, and a variety of user properties, credentials, and roles. Relevant research trusts in the project include: identity schemes and representation formats; use of ontology and issues related to identity interoperability; anonymity, dependability, accountability, and forensic-friendly identification schemes; psychological and social aspects related to the use of digital identities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Abstract: Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) promotes new mechanisms and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;methods to improve separation of concerns in software design. AOP is not&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;well understood in theory, and remains controversial among researchers and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;practitioners. One issue is that it relies on implementation-dependent,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;implicit side effects, contradicting traditional views on abstraction,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information hiding, and compositional reasoning. The PIs&amp;apos; goals are to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;explicate fundamental mechanisms of AOP; assess and improve the impact of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;AOP on decomposition and coupling; and improve our understanding of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;inherent complexity of, and potential for, compositional reasoning involving&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;AOP. The approach is to ground AOP in an underlying ontology of implicit&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;invocation and then to leverage knowledge in that domain to advance our&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;understanding of AOP. The intellectual significance of the proposed work is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in its potential to improve our understanding of AOP, including effects on&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;modularity and abstraction, and the complexity of specification and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;verification. Broader impacts are anticipated to flow from regularized and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;improved AOP mechanisms, e.g., for event abstraction. The project will also&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;support development and delivery of a senior-level undergraduate and early&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;graduate course on AOP.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides funding for the development of a science of health care quality that can provide an explanatory theory of the determinants of quality, provide a contextualized framework for health service research to understand what works, generate a mathematical model of critical inputs/output interactions, and generate metrics that provide institutional guidance rather than report cards. As with any science, the structure includes a theory that explains observable phenomena, Axioms, or First Principles that generate testable hypotheses and models, identification of relevant ontology, and methodologies, and above all, be useful. Beside the rather substantial impact of potentially transforming health care quality from an art to a science, the use of Unified Component Modeling to develop mathematical models of the principle components of our Mutual Understanding Theory of Health Care Quality, will impact data mining techniques, predictive modeling, characterization of stochastic and deterministic systems, Bayesian learning and data-user interface methodologies.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the results of this research will impact health care quality and cost, improve patient outcomes, and contribute to the broader field of service science. The increasing contribution of service industries to the American economy has opened interest in organizational structures that support service innovation, how to measure service productivity, the relationship between client satisfaction, including, marketing and objective outcome measures and appropriate methodologies for predicting service demand, service capacity, and inventorying employee skill-sets. This work will contribute to each of these areas.</Abstract>

<Abstract>In ill-defined domains such as engineering design and ethics, mathematical discovery, and law, problems often have more than one &amp;apos;right&amp;apos; answer. In such situations decision-makers propose rules or hypotheses about how to decide the problem in light of past cases and underlying principles and policies; through this process of interpretive argument decision-makers may then pose hypothetical examples in order to draw out and test the normative, logical, or empirical consequences of the hypothesis. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In integrating decision rules, case analogies, hypothetical examples, underlying principles, and policies, interpretive argument is a paradigm of robust reasoning. Although the problems are ill-defined, interpretive argument has an underlying logic, which this project is modeling computationally. By working in successively more complex argument microworlds, families of cases, rules, concepts, principles and policies drawn from realistic legal domains, the project is developing an ontology and implementing inference control mechanisms and argument schema with which a computer program will engage in interpretive argument. Empirical evaluation of the computational model is comparing arguments by the computer and by human arguers.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The work contributes to the fields of AI, argumentation theory, AI and Law, and case-based reasoning, and it aims in the longer term to contribute to intelligent tutoring systems that will prepare students for making effective, supportable and otherwise rational arguments, and to design artificial agents as proxies and advocates for humans engaged in disputes.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is an historical investigation into scientific and technological approaches to the sense of smell in the 18th and 19th centuries. Five interrelated trends in this history will be examined: (1) the influence of pre-Enlightenment understandings of olfaction on later technical endeavors; (2) natural philosophical inquiry into the sense of smell in the British and French Enlightenment and its impact on the growth of the human sciences; (3) disciplinary developments related to olfaction in the natural sciences, especially chemistry; (4) the craft traditions involved in-and subsequent industrialization of-the production of odoriferous substances; and (5) interest in olfaction in the context of the life sciences. These topics have received sparse treatment in the critical literature on conceptual and practical approaches to sensation and perception. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Technical approaches to olfaction and odor will be approached in the same spirit as recent STS work in the genre known as biography of scientific objects. The object in question smell (here meaning both the sensory mode and the phenomenon itself) will be characterized using a series of six important historical vantage points, each emphasizing a particular aspect of the same ongoing story. These episodes will illuminate, in context, the work of such important figures in olfactory science as Linnaeus, Fourcroy, Cloquet, Zwaardemaaker, and Ramon y Cajal. In addition, institutional trends in the various disciplines and enterprises related to smell will be examined, using this set of discrete vantage points to highlight different perspectives. This study will emphasize both philosophical and historical themes in conjunction. The philosophical aspect will accentuate the role attributed to olfaction as a potential and actual source of knowledge, and the consequences of this role for theories of knowledge production. The detailed historical account will demonstrate the abiding technical interest in smell in the past three centuries and describe the gradual development of related theories, practices, and techniques. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A better understanding of past developments related to smell has the potential to influence a number of fields. While experientially and emotionally powerful, olfaction has often been ignored or derided in both technical and philosophical circles. Recently, new work in STS has begun to redress some of this inattention, but the base of expertise in the United States remains underdeveloped given the many potential areas of impact. Smell provides a valuable perspective from which to approach questions about the fundamental role of epistemic instruments in the sciences, and the possible distinctions between representation and reality and between subjective and objective experience. Furthermore, the material-chemical nature of olfaction makes it of special interest in historical and conceptual studies of chemistry, helping to connect this area of inquiry quite directly to issues of epistemology, ontology, and the philosophy of technology. Thus, broader impacts of funding this work will include: (1) fostering of interdisciplinary connections among different perspectives on science and technology; (2) significant contributions to under-examined topics in STS; and (3) promotion of international dialogue on important historical and conceptual issues that have, until lately, been disregarded in this country.</Abstract>

Bloebaum &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Abstract &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research objective of this award is to investigate two novel research approaches to understanding and managing technology obsolescence challenges: (1) a knowledge representation scheme and management system that can facilitate information sharing and collaboration for obsolescence management and mitigation efforts between existing tools and across different organizations; and (2) fundamental principles, teachable methods, and guidelines for designing product architectures that can evolve with changing requirements, enabling proactive obsolescence management across the entire product life cycle. Fast moving technologies have caused commercial high-tech components to have shortened procurement life cycles, rendering them obsolete quickly. The impact and pervasiveness of obsolescence problems are growing. Existing work focuses on reactively managing obsolescence, i.e., minimizing the cost of resolving the problem after it has occurred, however, reactive management is very expensive and inefficient. Proactive and strategic obsolescence management have many potential advantages, but are poorly understood in theory, and poorly addressed in practice. Deliverables include a standard obsolescence ontology within a software system that domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields, demonstration and validation of fundamental principles on a wide range of product design problems, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for underprivileged undergraduate students. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the results of this research will overcome limitations in existing design methods that do not adequately consider obsolescence issues. This research will provide a platform for the exploration and understanding of interactions among the elements of product design and sensitivities to obsolescence. Designers will have the tools they need to manage the issue of obsolescence and design products to enable proactive obsolescence management. The results of this research will be disseminated to provide an opportunity to create cost-effective, and environmental friendly products at faster pace. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. The education and outreach activities of this effort will help promote interest for engineering from underrepresented groups.</Abstract>

An evaluation will be implemented focused initially on two tasks: identification of biologically significant entities; and extraction of relation information such as interactions or identification of Gene Ontology terms in the literature. A gold standard of training and test corpora will be obtained by using expert annotated data from BIND, SWISS-PROT and other model organism databases. These data sets will be made available to a wide community through a website. Organizations in computational linguistics and information retrieval will also be involved. The overall strategy is to focus on problems of importance to working biologists, such as improved curation tools for biological databases, and better access to textual information in both the literature and in curated databases. This approach provides infrastructure and support to multiple research groups. It also supports creation of training and test corpora to support many machine learning and statistical pattern recognition experiments.</Abstract>

<Abstract>ABSTRACT&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;0325269&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Ana Anton&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;North Carolina State&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Objectives: The objectives of the proposed work are to (a) develop a framework and software tools that support policy and requirements specification, run-time privacy enforcement and end-user privacy management, and (b) conduct surveys of members of the public who use IT systems for information transactions to investigate their perceptions of rights, permissions and obligations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Results: There are three main expected results of this work. First, tools will be produced to aid policy makers in determining the ramifications of policy changes to ensure that, as policy evolves, conflicts and inconsistencies may be prevented. Second, tools will be produced to aid organizations as they enforce and verify policy compliance.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Third, tools will be produced to empower end-users to manage their own privacy. Intellectual Merit Claims: This work aims to bridge two cultures of scholarship and research: technical specification and privacy policy. Specifications of systems typically concentrate on system-level entities (e.g. cookies), whereas policy discussions emphasize fundamental rights discursively. This proposal will formulate a framework ontology of rights, permissions and obligations (RPO) based on rigorous models of obligation and action&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;similar to those previously used by the Co-PI in research into requirements specification, but informed also by the best current models from formal jurisprudence. The proposed surveys of user views about RPOs concerning personal information in the healthcare domain are informed by the PI&amp;apos;s previous work in methodologies of goal refinement in e-commerce and other applications of IT and her survey research conducted under an existing NSF ITR grant and will directly influence the construction of tools that support the specification and compliance checking of policydriven IT systems. These tools in turn will integrate the framework and survey results with an industry standard privacy preferences platform, P3P, going beyond P3P to allow specification and monitoring of privacy RPOs at a semantic level that users and IT professionals share. The project team has a proven track record of successful research collaboration on requirements and policy analysis that bridges the two cultures identified. The proposed activity is creative in its foundational thinking and promises to produce currently unavailable technology and survey results. The project activities are distributed over the course of five years with proactive management by the PI with workshops scheduled to help track progress and invite external evaluation of project results. North Carolina State &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;University and Georgia Tech are well equipped and supported to conduct this work.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The science community has increasingly employed multi-method approaches to scientific exploration with an increasing reliance on computational methods. This is particularly the case with the science of climate and global environmental change. With this evolution has come the fundamental importance of data storage and archiving. There is an open problem in archiving digital science data that affects many fundamental science initiatives. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We propose an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) (2009) compliant data archival repository that lives early in the scientific research pipeline, supporting the ingest and access mechanisms that users have become accustomed to and have staff to support, while simultaneously providing support for curation and preservation of data, and making relational database, and eventually other databases, more usable in real time by researchers and policy makers. The testbed for this approach is the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) database, the most complete data archive of how communities develop strategies for sustainable forest management. The IFRI scientific user community consists of field visits every five years to over 250 diverse sites in 11 countries.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed repository conceptually wraps the original database into a unit that also contains a metadata catalog and provenance collection tool with interaction and replication guided by the OAIS standard. A fundamental research question in this effort is the data model that maps a database schema to an object model which abstracts scientific intent. The abstraction of scientific intent is grounded in a general conceptual model for reasoning about the life cycle of social-ecological systems and their interactions and outcomes. We thus expect to generalize the tools and data model that provide the map from a database to the science-oriented conceptual model expressed as an ontology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The International Forestry Resources and Institutions network includes twelve Collaborating Research Centers in ten countries on four continents. The early research conducted in this project will form a foundation for outreach through IFRI that could have broad potential for science and policy impacts worldwide. The proposal funds a computer science graduate student and postdoctoral fellow who will be engaged in interdisciplinary research in an area of emerging importance in the next many generations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A critical component of the long term success of the ideas of this proposal will be by getting word out. Therefore we will seek to present talks about these tools and approach long-term digital data collection projects, particularly ones focused on environmental monitoring such as LTER and OOI.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Computer Science (31) &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Wikis, known as collaborative knowledge building environments, are being used to facilitate computer mediated collaboration among undergraduate students working in project-based settings. As educational technology becomes an integral part of the instructional engineering landscape and distance education becomes accepted practice, understanding how students learn engineering becomes intertwined with understanding how computer mediated communication helps and hinders learning. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Pedagogical Wiki project is creating a novel framework for assessing and scaffolding collaborative learning within Wiki environments. Research being undertaken includes (a) studying student adoption and interaction in new and ongoing Wiki-based engineering courses, and comparing Wiki adoption in non-engineering (education) courses;(b) developing instructional assessment tools based on discourse analysis and course topic ontology for qualitatively evaluating student Wiki interactions; and (c) identifying scaffolding opportunities, such as topic-based material sharing, to promote student engagement and communication. Activity Theory is being used as a framework to study Wiki adoption.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Ultimately, a key component of this work lies in the new discourse and topic-based instruments that enable instructors and educational researchers to better assess student learning within Wiki environments. Qualitative as well as quantitative metrics are being developed, some with respect to the particular domains being studied. The combined use of new natural language processing techniques and traditional instruments to study Wiki adoption in an engineering context contributes to an understanding of how students learn engineering in a collaborative, &amp;quot;real-world&amp;quot; medium. Codifying best practices for computer mediated collaboration is impacting the way engineering is being taught.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of California-San Diego is awarded a grant to create a research coordination network to promote and integrate standards for genomic and metagenomic data and metadata within an international community. The network is based on the existing Genomic Standard Consortium and will be extended under this award to include ecological data standards such as Ecological Metadata Language, biodiversity standards such as Darwin Core, and environmental research programs such as the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network and Long Term Ecological Research. Genome enabled research has transformed biological sciences for the entire breadth of scales from molecular to ecosystems. Expanding and fully incorporating early consensus building, technical standards and the institutional commitments inspired and implemented by the Genomic Standards Consortium, the creation of this RCN for the Genome Standards Consortium (RCN4GSC) will ensure a worldwide, community driven process for establishing standardized mechanisms for the electronic capture of genomic data and for obtaining willingness to participate; these are essential to ensure effective use of the sequence and associated data, to provide access for all biologists to all of the information, and to create interdisciplinary opportunities for discovery. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Intense collaborations around the maturation of GCDML, Genome Rosetta Stone and the Genome Catalogue will be an early focus. Productivity will be sustained year round by routine A.V. and web-enabled interactions, including small working group sessions and collaborations via the RCN&amp;apos;s extant web hub at http://gensc.org. The activities will expand ongoing coordination required for implementation, including the Genome Catalog, GCDML, Genome Rosetta Stone software, Habitat-Lite and Environmental Ontology, and the eJournal &amp;quot;Standards in Genomic Sciences&amp;quot;. The RCN will also sustain and build upon the very active, ongoing, two-way exchange between LTER and GSC, interactions arising from common goals. The RCN4GSC will be an open organization, welcoming inspired biologists with a commitment to community service, and will increase participation from Asia and the USA. Coordination with professional societies and communication to federal and foundation stakeholders will be among strategies for expanding participation; these will be managed by the Communications Committee, who will focus on enlisting further diversity in participation and in reaching out to young biologists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project explores a novel principled framework for learning generic models of collective activities. Examples of collective activities are: people talking; a group of zebras escaping from a lion. Such models are used, in turn, for detecting, classifying, and segmenting activities as well as indentifying activities that differ from the collective behavior from videos sequences. Research developed in this project is distinctly different from previous research on action classification wherein activities are analyzed by considering individuals in isolation. Furthermore, unlike many current contributions, the aim is to work under unrestrictive conditions such as dynamic cluttered background, moving, monocular and un-calibrated cameras.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Key intellectual contributions of this project are: i) a learning scheme based on Random Forest that is able to adaptively characterize the coherent behavior of individuals, thus enabling discriminative classification of collective activities. This learning scheme is also relevant to other visual recognition tasks using context (e.g., scene and object recognition); ii) a methodology based on Relational Dependency Networks for segmenting different collective activities and discovering anomalous ones. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project can provides critical building blocks toward addressing high level visual problems such as modeling the interaction between humans/animals and objects, constructing an ontology of human/animal activities, modeling complex human/animal behaviors. This research has a potential to play a transformative role in strategic areas such as robotics and navigation. It also provides a crucial tool for analyzing and studying typical spatial-temporal collective behaviors in biology (insects, animals) or biomedicine (cells).</Abstract>

<Abstract>Last Modified Date: 06/13/09 Last Modified By: Christina L. Bloebaum &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Abstract &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research objective of this award is to investigate two novel research approaches to understanding and managing technology obsolescence challenges: (1) a knowledge representation scheme and management system that can facilitate information sharing and collaboration for obsolescence management and mitigation efforts between existing tools and across different organizations; and (2) fundamental principles, teachable methods, and guidelines for designing product architectures that can evolve with changing requirements, enabling proactive obsolescence management across the entire product life cycle. Fast moving technologies have caused commercial high-tech components to have shortened procurement life cycles, rendering them obsolete quickly. The impact and pervasiveness of obsolescence problems are growing. Existing work focuses on reactively managing obsolescence, i.e., minimizing the cost of resolving the problem after it has occurred, however, reactive management is very expensive and inefficient. Proactive and strategic obsolescence management have many potential advantages, but are poorly understood in theory, and poorly addressed in practice. Deliverables include a standard obsolescence ontology within a software system that domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields, demonstration and validation of fundamental principles on a wide range of product design problems, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for underprivileged undergraduate students. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the results of this research will overcome limitations in existing design methods that do not adequately consider obsolescence issues. This research will provide a platform for the exploration and understanding of interactions among the elements of product design and sensitivities to obsolescence. Designers will have the tools they need to manage the issue of obsolescence and design products to enable proactive obsolescence management. The results of this research will be disseminated to provide an opportunity to create cost-effective, and environmental friendly products at faster pace. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. The education and outreach activities of this effort will help promote interest for engineering from underrepresented groups.</Abstract>

<Abstract>DataBridge&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;There are currently thousands of scientists creating millions of data sets describing an increasingly diverse matrix of social and physical phenomena. This rapid increase in both amount and diversity of data implies a corresponding increase in the potential of data to empower important new collaborative research initiatives. However, the sheer volume and diversity of data presents a new set of challenges in locating all of the data relevant to a particular line of research. Taking full advantage of the unique data managed by the &amp;quot;long-tail of science&amp;quot; requires new tools specifically created to assist scientists in their search for relevant data sets. DataBridge is an e-science collaboration environment tool designed specifically for the exploration of a rich set of sociometric tools and the corresponding space of relevance algorithms, and their adaptation to define semantic bridges that link large numbers of diverse datasets into a sociometric network. Data from several large NSF funded projects will be analyzed to develop relevance-based data discovery methods. Sociometric network analysis (SNA) algorithms will be used to explore the space of relevancy (different ways data can be related to each other) by metadata and ontology, by pattern analysis and feature extraction, and via human connections. By linking data, human interactions, and usage methods and practices, rich models of social networks inter-connecting massive long tail science data can be created that enhance scientific collaboration and discovery. DataBridge supports advances in Science and Engineering by directly enabling and improving discovery of relevant scientific data across large, distributed and diverse collections. The system will also provide an easy means of publishing data to the DataBridge and incentivize data producers to do so by enabling collaboration and citation. The design will be domain-agnostic and highly extensible and adaptive, supporting inclusion of new relevance algorithms and indexing techniques. DataBridge will be distributed under an open source license enabling wider use and crowd-sourced improvements of the technology. The concepts developed in the project - semantically linking data through sociometric network analysis - will have an impact on non-scientific data collections and will effectively improve access and discovery of information over the web.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Intellectual Merit: This project will develop transcriptomics approaches to investigate gene regulation as a function of environmental cycles and in response to experimental manipulation. Currently, there are few tools to establish physiological state of marine zooplankton, in particular for oceanic species. Molecular approaches based on quantifying the transcriptome could serve as powerful tools to obtain a physiological profile for individuals and groups of individuals collected in the field. In combination with laboratory experiments, transcriptome analysis will provide a new approach to understanding organism-environment interactions in the pelagic zone.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI will focus on a model planktonic crustacean, Calanus finmarchicus, to develop the molecular tools. C. finmarchicus, a calanoid copepod, is highly abundant in the North Atlantic, with populations extending from the Gulf of Maine and Labrador Sea to the North Sea. Pyrosequencing and microarray technologies will be used to develop a diagnostic tool to determine physiological state in C. finmarchicus. The goal of having a measurement of physiological state is to determine if individuals in the population are growing, are synthesizing or catabolizing storage lipids, and are metabolically active and/or experiencing environmental stress. Specific objectives of this project include:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. High throughput sequencing of C. finmarchicus transcriptome from pre-adult (copepodid stage V [CV]) individuals representing distinct phases of the annual cycle (late spring-early summer, early fall, diapausing individuals).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Analysis of the sequence data for discovery of seasonally regulated genes for the development of an ecologically relevant microarray. Probes for this microarray will include seasonally regulated genes, genes involved in the environmental stress response and control genes.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3. Preliminary testing of microarray on existing samples collected from the Gulf of Maine and stored in liquid nitrogen, as well as on experimentally manipulated animals.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: 1) Training of graduate and undergraduate students in these techniques will occur. At least two graduate students in Marine Sciences/Biological Oceanography will participate in the project and be trained in transcriptomics at the bench and in bioinformatics. Undergraduate students will participate in the project at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory through the NSF REU-site funding. Undergraduate training will be interdisciplinary and include both biological oceanography and molecular biology techniques. 2) Results and sequences obtained in this study will be contributed to databanks and made available to the general public. Sequences will be analyzed using clustering tools and annotated using gene ontology software, followed by sequence submission to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Gene sequence data for copepods in general are still sparse, and the planned submission will increase information available for calanoid copepods by ten-fold or more.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The spread of contagions such as opinions, attitudes, beliefs, and diseases across a national population is a well-known complex problem; the recent fear of avian flu epidemics and financial contagion serve as excellent examples. Other examples include: opinions, fads, trends, norms, packet diffusion, worm propagation in computer networks and database replication in sensor networks. In this project the investigators propose to develop MTML-Sim: a Multi-Theory Multi-Level (MTML) modeling framework, operating over extremely large dynamic socio-technical networks, in which multiple contagions and behaviors are simultaneously co-evolving by repeated interactions. MTML-Sim will use computational agent-based methods resolved at an individual level to represent and compute the co-evolving dynamics. The goal is to scale MTML-Sim to billions of individual agents connected by multi-level social and information networks, and efficiently execute on 100,000-processor petascale architectures that will come online in the next few years. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;MTML-Sim will provide practical methods to support academic researchers as well as policy makers before and during large-scale cascades caused by the spread of contagion. The broader impacts of the project will be achieved by tools used to identify critical elements in the socio-technical networks before the start of cascades, and by potential interventions for controlling the cascades based on the understanding of the effects of individual and group behavior within the dynamically evolving socio-technical networks.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The researchers intend to develop a database organizing sentence data from three highly endangered Alaskan Athabascan languages: Koyukon, Lower Tanana, and Upper Tanana. Much of the data is already available in published and manuscript dictionaries, or in texts and language learning materials, but it is not currently accessible to researchers and language teachers in readily comparable form. Additional data will be collected as part of this project to fill gaps and to enrich and clarify what has been previously archived. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The database will organize the data from two perspectives: form-to-function and function-to-form. In selecting the constructions/forms to be included, we will consult a number of grammars of other Athabascan languages such as Rice (1989) and de Reuse and Goode (2006). In the selection of functions to be included, we will use extant tools such as the World Atlas on Language Structures (Dryer &amp;amp; Haspelmath 2011) and the GOLD ontology (Farrar &amp;amp; Langedoen 2003) to build our categories. Examples of search terms on the formal side are independent pronouns, classifiers, interrogative particles, or extra-high tone (to name but a few); on the functional side commands (both positive and negative), questions, topicalization, and many more. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Searching by form will be useful to researchers familiar with Athabascan languages; searching by function to researchers interested in typological questions. Additionally, this tool will be a helpful resource for Athabascan language learners and educators, who need references for curriculum development.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Educators at all levels have begun to exploit children&amp;apos;s attraction to games. However, until recently, especially at the K12 level, it has been assumed that learners were consumers of games and not their producers. The goal of the Pedagogical Game project is to develop and evaluate a secondary school curriculum for learning standards-based content via collaborative game-making. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that creating computer games (game-making) can engage students in learning standards-based content and significantly impact achievement and retention and that collaborative game design can be a powerful tool for encouraging open negotiation and argumentation, a core element in promoting creativity. The interdisciplinary and project-based approach to learning will encourage art/theater and math/science students to work together in a collaborative setting and promote differentiation of learning tasks and student-centered learning. Research being undertaken includes (a) developing collaborative game making curriculum where standard based math content is effectively integrated; (b) identifying scaffolding opportunities, such as promoting student collaboration and reflection through online discussions and wiki-based journaling; (c) developing instructional assessment tools based on discourse analysis and course topic ontology that will monitor student progress over time according to the game making project goals.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed work will strengthen and evaluate a fledgling game-building curriculum that was created to address the educational needs of at-risk high school students in underperforming schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The program has a large potential to positively impact the education and lives of our at-risk student population. The intellectual merit of the project includes a game-making curriculum with embedded standards and new ways to promote and evaluate collaboration in a game-making context. The results of the project will have broad societal impact by enhancing the ability of students from traditionally under-represented groups to participate in STEM fields of study while learning 21st century career skills. The project will also contribute to the knowledge base through careful empirical evaluation of the benefits of creative new instructional strategies (game-making, project-based learning) that support learning styles and strategies preferred by students who have had difficulty excelling in mathematics learning. With the support of LAUD teachers and staff, we are poised to develop and integrate the program into the curriculum and scale its adoption. Its success has the potential to transform learning strategies for at risk students.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is concerned with problems inherent in the informal specification of design. Its task is to develop a domain independent, generic knowledge-based requirement elicitation tool for design, called DDSC (Dynamic Design Specification with Chunking). Capturing design requirements is usually the task of knowledge engineers and is often done by post hoc knowledge acquisition, which in general is inadequate and difficult. In this approach however, design specification is a dynamic process evolving interactively. The elicitation process is based on the structure of human cognition through the use of recognized cognitive categories. DDSC takes as input an initial, informal requirement specification for a design object, as well as an extended generic ontology of the design process, and generates a complete, unambiguous, consistent, and implementable requirement specification of the desired design object. It does so by ewalkingn the Designer and the User Agents through the design process. During this ewalk-through,n requirements are chunked down with the help of Chunking Agents into implementable bits. DDSC is a participatory design tool which differs from any existing generic tool. Its application will greatly contribute to minimizing the huge gap which exists between informal specification and design implementation.</Abstract>

PERFMINER, a system for continuous performance optimization via mining, will enable a distributed object system to: 1) discover its own critical path, 2) detect new opportunities for speculative processing, and 3) to facilitate modifying an object&amp;apos;s behaviors (i.e., methods) at run-time in response to newly acquired knowledge.</Abstract>

The instrumentation will be mainly utilized by research projects on privacy, assured information sharing, and reference monitoring in the School of Engineering and Computer Science in collaboration with scientist from Economics, Policy and Political Science, Management, Natural Science, and Mathematics at the institution. Additionally, the instrument will be available for use by researchers in the combined technology program between School of Arts and Humanities and Engineering. Moreover, it will be available to researchers in national and international academic, industrial, and governmental institutions. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Researchers at the institution currently work in the area sponsored by NSF, AFOSR, NIH, DARPA, and Army. All this sponsored research can gain by having the cloud instrument be secured for many applications. Both research and education projects have a strong need to process massive amounts of data securely, for example, encrypted data for research on secure multi-party computation techniques, where large amounts of semantic web data have to be exchanged securely among multiple parties for assured information sharing among coalition partners. The education courses involve experimentation with malware detection tools and distributed forensics on the cloud. The instrument will be made available to multiple departments and have applications in several domains including science and engineering, healthcare, homeland security, defense and intelligence, law enforcement, space, banking and finance, power management, and environmental protection. Consequently, it will benefit the national community such as the open science research community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will create software infrastructure and sociotechnical mechanisms that let agencies engage the efforts of citizens in order to gather data and even take on small tasks in their local communities. Realizing this aim requires filling significant technological gaps: (1) no robust software infrastructure that enables a broad range of community activities, (2) no general set of incentive mechanisms that organizers can use to attract and motivate citizen participation, and (3) no software tools for organizers to monitor effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project takes on these challenges through research on four central topics. First, it will create a general ontology of tasks, coordination mechanisms, incentives, and user interfaces for organizers to define goals. Second, it will develop algorithms to match participants and tasks, and user interfaces for participants to find tasks of interest. The third topic is automated mechanisms and visualization tools for organizers to monitor progress and adjust parameters such as incentives or participation qualifications. Fourth, it will create interfaces for participants to visualize their contributions and view incentives they have earned or are eligible to earn, based on techniques to model users based on their participation. The technical results will be embodied in a software infrastructure which will be deployed and used as a platform for empirical evaluation of the developed algorithms and interaction techniques. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The key scientific outcomes of this project will be a general and integrated software infrastructure for social participation efforts, a diverse catalog of incentive mechanisms and guidelines for use, a novel set of task matching and participant recruiting techniques, automated and semi-automated techniques to monitor and dynamically adjust progress, and empirical knowledge of how these novel algorithms and interaction techniques work in practice. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The infrastructure developed through this research has great potential for enabling local government agencies to gather much more, accurate, and timely data to inform their decisions. It also can help citizens to become involved with their communities, finding constructive tasks to take on that require differing amounts of skill and time commitments. An even broader potential impact is that the products of this research can help renew the relationship between local governments and citizens, making government more responsive to citizens and giving citizens greater faith in their governments.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the development of novel methods for ideation and innovation through the discovery of lateral connections in otherwise unconnected knowledge networks. In many fields of human knowledge and activity, a common feature is that information content is expanding at such a rate that finding relevant results to searches for solutions is becoming increasingly difficult. A further problem is that even the high quality material is expanding at such a rate that most disciplines are rapidly forming sub-disciplines. As fields continue to both expand both at the top levels in terms of overall amount of knowledge, and to expand at the more granular levels by fragmentation into ever more numerous subfields, each of which may develop its own journals, conferences and even terminology, impenetrable to the outsider. It&amp;apos;s becoming impossible to stay current. Yet much of creativity occurs, and indeed a great many of the world?s great inventions have occurred, precisely at the intersections between different fields. The central objective of this Phase I project will be to determine the utility of a parsable ontology for supporting ideation and innovation by connecting diverse knowledge domains. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans multiple fields and markets, including but not limited to pharmaceuticals, medical devices, materials science, semiconductor devices, chemical processing, legal discovery, patent analyses, and financial analytics. In each of these fields, there is often an increase in &amp;apos;silo-ing&amp;apos; of different knowledge domains, with the development of access and language barriers in between them, presenting clear challenges to academia and industry. As this situation worsens, there is need of ever better ways to organize, translate and present information to users, and to find solutions to users&amp;apos; problems (their &amp;apos;unmet needs&amp;apos;). What is needed, and not yet offered by any competitor, is an exploration system giving searchers a strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results having come from a diverse, unexpected, and potentially provocative source. This will break down silos by providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different disciplines to facilitate the ready spread of awareness of a potential solution from one field to another, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. The initial customer focus will be on particular corporate clients with a heavy investment in R&amp;amp;D activities and a high probability of internal silo-ing of knowledge, such as pharmaceutical companies.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The principal investigator and his colleagues develop computational and theoretical framework to analyze large data sets with low-dimensional intrinsic structure. More specifically, they address the following challenges: Constructions of underlying curves and surfaces in the presence of significant outliers and noise; Improvement of recent nonlinear embedding techniques for large data sets with significant noise; Analysis of large data sets generated by special nonlinear partial differential equations with low-dimensional inertial manifold. There are several important applications of the proposed research: quantitative edge detection in images, detection of nuclear devices by muon radiation, identification of protein-binding genomic regions (and even specific sites), quantitative exploration of the functional domain in the gene ontology and its relation with structural properties.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The broader impacts of the proposal are as follows: 1) The mathematics suggests important applications, some of them are listed above. 2) The applications guide and demand a broad framework for multiscale geometric analysis of data sets with intrinsic low-dimensional geometric structures. 3) Interaction between different areas of mathematics, in particular, computational harmonic analysis, scientific computation, statistical learning, probability and mathematical modeling. 4) Multidisciplinary collaborations, involving applied mathematicians, biologists, computer scientists, statisticians and mathematical analysts. 5) Industrial collaborations. 6) Training of young researchers in a promising new area of mathematics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will create a web-based electronic archive, audio-dictionary and searchable database of word lists, personal narratives, and naturally-occurring conversation for the severely endangered Koasati language. Koasati (iso639 code CKU) is a Muskogean language with a rapidly declining population of fluent speakers. Recent tribal surveys have found fewer than 170 fluent speakers, an alarming degree of language shift, and virtually no intergenerational transmission of the language. For those who want to overcome this shift, new materials are needed. Despite intermittent linguistic attention over the past century, no record of naturally-occurring Koasati speaker interactions, communication events, or elicited personal narratives exists. The Tribe strongly believes that there is a timely and urgent need to capture the naturally occurring speech of the remaining fluent Koasati speakers in actual use before this language fades away. This filmic language documentation project will address this need by conducting fieldwork to systematically document naturally-occurring Koasati speech in digital video format; training tribal members in current &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot; documentation methods; creating a searchable electronic database that is navigable in Koasati and English; and developing a web-based electronic archive for Koasati. The Co-PIs are a husband-wife team comprised of the director of the tribe&amp;apos;s language program who is himself a tribal member and native speaker of Koasati, and a professor of anthropology who has worked in the Koasati community documenting traditional history, culture and language for the past sixteen years. Additional project personnel include two renowned Creek language scholars and eight fluent speakers who will work on the project as consultants, transcribers, and Advisory Board members. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In addition to increasing the body of linguistic data available for the highly endangered Koasati language, this project will provide a model for other communities initiating similar documentation projects, particularly by training tribal members in data collection methods and uses of electronically archived linguistic materials. The broader impact of this project will also be felt as the multimedia database created for the Koasati language provides new data for comparison with other Muskogean languages, and at the discretion of the Tribal Council, is made available for efforts to build a linguistic ontology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The project proposed is a continuation of the PIs ITR proposal titled &amp;quot;Collaborative Research: Marine Metadata Interoperability Project&amp;quot;, proposed as a first step in an effort to improve the ease of use of data from ocean observations by developing broader agreement within the ocean science community on &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; for marine metadata. The results of this effort included creation and maintenance of a central, community-oriented, collaboratively developed web site for oceanographic metadata. Addition tasks included references, ontology, standards, and Metadata Cookbook development, Metadata Interoperability demonstrations, and workshop.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The current proposal builds on the previous work and recent advances in computer sciences, geosciences, and the biomedical field, and provide guidance on metadata development and application in the ocean science community. The work will support the NSF priority of designing and implementing interoperable observing systems such as ORION, as well as the metadata priorities in the U.S. IOOS DMAC plan. The work will create infrastructure to directly support the successful construction and operation of these major systems, as well as interoperability of many other smaller systems. This will directly benefit the developers and users of marine data systems, including international users.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI&amp;apos;s will engage and inform the community through the continued development of the MMI website, as well as through workshops, email list servers, presentations, and peer reviewed publications. They will build on an existing wide base of support, as evidenced by the attached letters, and provide community-backed leadership toward solving the major metadata challenges in oceanographic science.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The MMI activities are a critical component of an overall strategy to provide potential users of marine data the capability to find and utilize the data they require. To NSF, MMI contributes towards providing the ability to find and more fully exploit ocean observations supported through NSF. The purpose of this proposed effort is not to develop the physical infrastructure needed to improve our ability to access, understand and use marine data, the proposed tools (both program oriented and Web-based), documentation, and outreach and training activities will provide for the enhancement of scientific and technological understanding. A program such as the MMI could potentially be an impetus towards facilitating integration across ocean, coastal and estuarine observing domains, although this will take continued funding past two year.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project proposes to extend the efforts of the Knowledge-Based Nursing Initiative (KBNI) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee by building a knowledge retrieval and storage system that provides clinical evidence in a format usable by nurses through linking the language of research to the language of nursing practice. In addition, exploring semantic relationships in the evidence will generate new nursing knowledge that will have a positive impact on the safety of patients and the quality of health care delivery. Learning opportunities will be provided for a diverse pool of students from several disciplines and at all levels in order to inculcate the next generation of scientists and practitioners with the vision and skills to implement and maintain interdisciplinary and multi-sector translational research. Finally, by creating a collaborative interdisciplinary environment within academia and across the healthcare delivery, HIT (Health Information Technology) corporate and academic sectors; the rapid translation of health discoveries into the practice environment to improve quality and safety of patient care will be facilitated. This project uses a technology solution to address a heretofore largely unsolved problem, viz., expedient and efficient translation of relevant research to nursing practice. The translation problem for nursing will be accomplished through the efforts of a strong inter-disciplinary team of nursing, computer science, informatics, and management researchers and with multisector partners. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The methods developed in this project may further be tested and applied to other areas of health care practice, particularly where there is a need for application of evidence from multiple domains, such as the practice of public health related to diseases of animals that can be transmitted to humans. There has been increasing regulatory and scientific attention to patient safety and quality in health care. There is the expectation that computer-aided clinical decision support will contribute to quality improvement and the reduction of medical errors. Underrepresented groups will benefit from changes to health practice engendered by this project, as the Knowledge Repository includes information about the gender and ethnicity of those who participated in the studies included. This will allow searches of the repository to identify the most relevant evidence for best-practices (or the lack of such evidence) for select under-represented groups.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Partners: Partners include University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (Lead Institution), Aurora Health Care, and Cerner Corporation.</Abstract>

<Abstract>As society becomes ever more dependent on computer systems, effective (and cost-effective) methods for assurance and certification are becoming critical. The field of formal verification has recently benefited from a surge of innovations in technology and in methods for combining technologies. These innovations, and especially their use in combination, are disruptive to traditional formal verification tools, which are mostly each built around a single technology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project seeks to harness and advance disruptive innovation in formal verification by constructing an Evidential Tool Bus (ETB) that will allow many different techniques to be applied cooperatively and in novel combinations to formal verification problems. The ETB supports the need for improved certification methods by managing the integration not only of its client tools, but also of the evidence that they supply. The goal of the ETB is to develop coherent chain of evidence from multiple sources, together with the provenance of each link in the chain. Formal logic and state machines are central concepts in verification. The ETB employs a simple ontology based on these concepts and an equally simple invocation model based on semantic interaction to create a lightweight, loosely coupled service-oriented architecture for formal analysis and verification.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project is developing a prototype ETB, which integrates tools from SRI and cooperating universities and research organizations. The ETB prototype is being used to perform formal verifications and develop certification evidence that will be made available as exemplars through the international Verified Software Grand Challenge Repository. The ETB is expected to prove a transformative resource for formal verification research and ultimately for certification.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Proposal Number: 0820060&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Title: SASSY: Self-Architecting Software Systems&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI: Daniel Menasce&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Co-PIs: Hassan Gomaa, Joao Sousa, Sam Malek&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research proposes a framework for Self-Architecting Software Systems (SASSY), a significant paradigm shift in architecting large-scale real-world software systems. Focusing on service-oriented architectures, SASSY includes: 1) Self-architecting: given the service and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, an optimal architecture is automatically generated with the aid of design patterns. The merit of architectural alternatives is evaluated with the aid of multivariate utility functions. 2) Activity-based specification: behavioral requirements are expressed as activity schemas annotated with QoS requirements and domain ontology. 3) Unification of evolution and adaptation: both the evolution of requirements and changes on monitored run-time conditions and QoS trigger the revaluation of architectural alternatives, and, to the extent possible, the automatic reconfiguration of systems. The intellectual merit lies in the development of a novel framework that advances the representation of software architecture and mixed-initiative activities, while integrating optimization theory and analytic models of QoS. The broader impact includes 1) improved productivity in the software industry, due to significant automation; 2) the open-source availability of the tools developed to support and validate this research; and 3) improved software engineering education by incorporating results of this research into graduate and undergraduate courses at George Mason University and publication at educational forums.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create and test a working semantic search platform using Search Maps to represent users&amp;apos; Search intent. The effort will extend the ontology used in Phase I and build a complete system for generating high quality search results for typical searches. The recommendation architecture uses the similarity between Search Maps to introduce users to websites already discovered by others with similar Search Maps. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, this project will enable a new type of semantic search called User-driven Search, creating a new Search-enabled layer on top of the World Wide Web. As new way for users to manage, express, and resolve their Searches anywhere on the Internet, Search Maps create a new metaphor for helping users get more value out of the World Wide Web, no matter where they go. Coordinating queries and Search results provides immediate value as an enhanced Search tracking service. Allowing users to seamlessly send their Search Map to any provider would allow users to shortcut the traditional search and navigation paradigm at any and every website they visit. The implications for e-commerce and enterprise search are significant.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research seeks to create a new global-scale information facility&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;on the Internet in which structured data, rather than raw text, is the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;key element supported. Currently, the information provided on the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Internet consists of simple text-based documents (HTML), or other&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;unstructured types such as images and streams. The new facility will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;allow data sources to be described by schemas and their content to be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;indexed and located. Sophisticated query-oriented database-style&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;operations will be possible over simple or complex data sources, and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;new views of multiple data sources can be created and shared with&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;other clients. A new class of data processing services will be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;possible to collect, manipulate, analyze, and store data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The first goal of project is to define the basic architecture of a&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;client, allowing it to share its data with other peers, participate in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;distributed query processing, and cooperate with other clients. A&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;specific data integration formalism will be designed that will allow&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;clients to integrate their data with others&amp;apos; using both global-as-view&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and local-as-view data integration paradigms. Building on this&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;arthictecture, a new query processing technique will be developed that&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;can adapt to both data integration paradigms. The project will then&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;develop intelligent data placement techniques for storing query&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;results on different clients, thus enabling dramatic performance&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;improvments for subsequent queries. The data such placed on servers&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;may become stale, when the source data gets updated: the project will&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;develop specific update propagation techniques for publishing and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;disseminating updates. Finally, the project is developing novel data&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;indexing techniques that allow clients to search data items globally.</Abstract>

<Abstract>AWARD ABSTRACT:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This pilot project will develop a high-throughput strategy to analyze native expression patterns and subcellular localization of Arabidopsis gene products of unknown function. This strategy, Fluorescent Tagging of Full-Length Proteins (FTFLP), will comprise five major steps: (1) Selection of &amp;quot;functionally unassigned&amp;quot; Arabidopsis genes and prediction of their protein structure and suitable site for fluorescent tag insertion (2) Amplification of each gene in two parts, with the junction between the two parts corresponding to our chosen insertion site for the fluorescent tag(3) Introduction of the fluorescent tag, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) using a triple overlap PCR approach (4) Insertion of PCR products into binary vectors (5) Production of transgenic Arabidopsis lines and analysis of expression pattern and intracellular localization for each tagged protein. As a pilot approach, the project aims to analyze a statistically significant number of genes to support the applicability to a subsequent wider study. To this end, approximately 800 genes (listed at the already operational project website http://arabidopsis.org/info/2010_projects/proteintagging.html) were selected from a total of ca. 8,000 unknown genes. This pilot list was chosen based on the following sequentially-applied criteria: 1) have matching full-length cDNA, 2) are annotated as &amp;apos;unknown protein&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;putative protein&amp;apos;, and 3) do not have any Gene Ontology annotations. The selected genes reflect the diversity of all the unknown Arabidopsis genes with respect to plant specificity, predicted domain and/or gene family information, and availability of matching full-length cDNA sequences.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;FTFLP as a tool for functional proteomics offers three significant advantages: it focuses on genes of unknown function, it produces internally-tagged full length proteins that are more likely to exhibit faithful intracellular localization, and it utilizes native promoters to allow us to determine tissue specificity. Three deliverables will be offered to the research community: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) Expression vectors harboring full-length sequences for each gene under its native promoter and tagged with YFP flanked by unique restriction sites,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing each construct, and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) A website and a searchable database containing information about the lines and constructs, including the gene sequences highlighted with positions of primers and tagging sites, vector construct information, images and text descriptions of the protein expression pattern and intracellular localization, and protocols and standard operation procedures in experimentation, analysis, and interpretation. Also, a Reference Protein Subcellular Localization Map will be constructed using fluorescently-tagged proteins with known intracellular targeting. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These resources will be available to the public through two unrestricted venues: DNA constructs and transgenic seeds will be distributed through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) whereas gene sequences and expression and subcellular localization data, including fluorescence microscopy images, will be disseminated via the project website integrated into The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR). Importantly, this sharing of the resources and results of this project through ABRC and TAIR, respectively, will take place on a continuous basis as the deliverables become available. Announcements on the availability of new resources will be made through such electronic media as the Bionet USENET newsgroups and parallel e-mail lists.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project significantly advances the overall objectives of the 2010 Project by characterizing on a large scale the expression and subcellular localization of unknown Arabidopsis genes. Our understanding of Arabidopsis biology will be glaringly incomplete without such knowledge. In addition, this project has a broader impact on the society and science. Once this pilot project demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach, it will serve a basis for developing a laboratory curriculum for use in cell biology training of high school students and teachers as well as beginning investigators at the CSHL DNA Learning Center and the annual Arabidopsis Molecular Genetics Course, and at the biannual UCR Plant Cell Biology course. Finally, a teaching outreach program with community colleges will involve undergraduates in summer research. Thus, our program will bridge genomic approaches with cell biology in the laboratory and classroom, and generate important novel information and tools to characterize the Arabidopsis proteome.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research investigates distributed trust management as an&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;alternative to traditional authentication and access control schemes&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in dynamic and pen computing environments such as multiagent systems,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;web services and pervasive computing. Distributed trust management&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;handles security with techniques used in human societies, where people&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;are judged on their abilities, assets, relationships and reputations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Authorization decisions are made through the application of relevant&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;security and trust policies, expressed in a high-level declarative&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;language. The policies define rules and constraints on agents (human&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;or software) and the actions they can take on objects in terms of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;their credentials and properties. This work extends the principles of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;trust management with deontic notions of rights, obligations, and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;prohibitions. An ontology grounded in a semantic language (e.g., RDF,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;DAML or OWL) is used to represent security information constituting&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;credentials, policies, beliefs, and proofs as well as relevant&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;domain-specific properties to characterize the agents, actions and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;objects. An important results will be a better understanding of how&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the semantic web can address the critical issues of security, trust&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and privacy in distributed open environments. The new concepts and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;techniques will be evaluated and demonstrated through the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;implementation of prototype tools and applications</Abstract>

<Abstract>1140073 (Gey). Nuclear forensics is the science of identification of source and characteristics of smuggled nuclear materials possibly seized by authorities (APS/AAAS Joint Working Group: Nuclear Forensics: Role, State of the Art, Program Needs,2008). Nuclear material identification is of utmost importance to international threat reduction and this project targets making a significant step in this effort. The nuclear materials identification process will be cast as a search problem against a digital library of standard nuclear materials samples and their digital signatures. This should prove useful to supply a conceptual, algorithmic approach to nuclear material identification and origination. Among the elements of the problem and questions to be resolved are: Can the identification of nuclear samples which represent the nodes in a nuclear decay chain be approached as a weighted, labeled directed graph matching problem? Can the standard XML representations of chemical materials and compounds be extended to represent the nuclear isotope decay chain process? From existing representations, nuclear decay theory can be used to extrapolate downstream (times after analysis) or upstream (time prior to sample analysis, up to time zero). Can a simulation approach be used to develop a pseudo-digital library derived from the differential equations of nuclear decay to test algorithmic research without having to operate under the veil of secrecy? This project seeks to answer these questions, develop a digital library of nuclear signatures, and field educational outreach to encourage more search specialists to dedicate research attention to the problems. Cooperation has been obtained from projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory (nuclear materials samples library) and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (nuclear ontology). The results of the project are targeted to include open-source code for nuclear forensics search to be made available to DNDO agencies and national laboratory groups, and to streamline the process of nuclear materials identification. This project is believed to be the first computer science algorithmic approach to the nuclear forensics search problem as a special directed graph matching problem. The success of this project would encourage other computer scientists to work on nuclear forensics search. Success in nuclear forensics search is a critical component to fighting terrorist activity and preventing disastrous individual terrorist nuclear attacks.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Intellectual Merit: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Protein phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism by which cells respond to environmental signals. In eukaryotes, protein phosphorylation is carried out by a large and diverse family of protein kinases, which display remarkable diversity and complexity in their modes of regulation. The complex modes of protein kinase regulation have evolved as a consequence of natural selection operating on genomic sequences for billions of years. Despite the availability of over 100,000 protein kinase sequences from diverse organisms, however, very little has been done to use the evolutionary information embedded in genomic sequences to understand the complexity and diversity of the protein kinase machinery. The overall goal of this project is to generate testable models of protein kinase evolution and regulation through quantitative and integrative analysis of protein kinase sequence, structure and functional data. Specific goals are to (i) quantify the sequence and structural similarities and differences between eukaryotic and distantly related eukaryotic-like kinases in prokaryotes, (ii) identify and experimentally characterize the evolutionary constraints acting on major protein kinase groups, in particular tyrosine kinases, which represent an important transition state in the evolution of the kinase domain, and (iii) provide conceptual representation of protein kinase sequence, structure and functional data in the form of an ontology. In order to accomplish these aims this project will use a novel evolutionary-systems approach in which mechanistic models of protein kinase regulation and evolution will be built and tested through quantitative and integrative analysis of sequence, structure and functional data. Accomplishing this project is expected to have a major impact by providing new testable hypotheses/models for experimental studies, a computational resource for large-scale integrative analysis of protein kinase data, and a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of regulation in other signaling domains.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The major educational goal of this project is to help students develop an understanding of the importance of evolutionary and integrative approaches in biology. To accomplish this goal, the investigator will develop and assess new educational tools useful for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about data integration and data mining. These tools will be piloted, assessed, revised and broadly disseminated to undergraduate educators through web-resources and publications. The investigator will provide research training for undergraduate and high school students through existing training programs at the University of Georgia, and incorporate under-represented minorities in educational and research activities by partnering with the NSF REU Fungal Genomics and Computational Biology program. The educational activities of this project will promote inquiry-based learning at the high school and undergraduate level, and prepare the next generation of scientists for careers in integrative biology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Proposal #: 11-35848&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI(s): Murphy, Robin&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Institution: Texas A&amp;amp;M University&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Title: RAPID: Sendai Earthquake and Tsunami- Remote Assessment Using Land, Sea &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and Aerial Unmanned Systems&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Project Proposed:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This RAPID project proposal, consisting of participatory research with land, sea, and aerial unmanned systems for remote assessment and situation awareness for critical life saving and recovery operations in the aftermath of the Sendai earthquake and tsunami, will capture and analyze valuable data on the effectiveness of various robots for recovery and inspection as well as user interface paradigms. The researchers will be engaged in some of the following activities: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Participate in the ongoing recovery efforts in the Sendai region and northward&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Gather data on the effectiveness of various robots in various real-world scenarios&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Gather data on the effectiveness of various user interfaces for remote devices during the recovery process&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Deploy the RESPOND-R mobile instrument (NSF MRI grant CNS-0923203) to inspect critical infrastructure&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI has secured invitations from Japanese researchers and responders, including the International Rescue Systems Institute, to bring robots to the north of Japan to assist in the inspection of critical infrastructure and other recovery operations as well as perform research on the efficacy of emergency response methods and practices. (The search and rescue phase has been terminated.) US and Japanese response teams will be deployed for victim and economic recovery decision-making while simultaneously collecting never-before-possible, ephemeral data. The Sendai disaster is unique in its large geographical and economic scale and types of damage. The geographical, damage, and economic scales drive the need for distributed decision-making, where experts will have to consult and work at a distance using remotely acquired data. Sendai also provides the first opportunity to create a corpus from multiple modalities of unmanned systems being used by the same agency. Of the 15 deployments since the first use of rescue robots at the 9-11 World Trade Center collapse, only two, Hurricanes Katrina and Haiti, used both sea and aerial vehicles; notwithstanding, these were controlled by different organizations for tasks by different agencies preventing a longitudinal survey of what works (or does not) for decision-makers and why and how assets should be coordinated.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This proposal promises an immediate benefit to society by supporting life saving and economic recovery efforts in Japan through a participatory research paradigm. There are also long term benefits for future disasters since emergency response and unmanned systems are both formative domains and the data collected will advance the discovery and understanding of intelligent, human-centered systems in unpredictable situations. The PI is a woman who is well known as a role model for recruiting women and minorities; the data from this project will be integrated into her numerous museum, documentary, K-12, and general public education events. Data gathered by the NSF-sponsored RESPOND-R mobile distributed instrument for response research will be organized into an ontology and made available as appropriate given the sensitive nature of video footage.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Northeastern University is awarded a grant to develop a system that analyzes figures in biological literature. The Biological Knowledge available online goes well beyond the data that is currently collected to populate databases. Much of the critical knowledge contained in the figures and text of published papers deals with complex biological systems such as cells and organisms and with aspects of experiments and results such as methods, observations, judgments, explanations, etc. Approximately 50% of the content of a typical Biology research paper is comprised of figures and discussions of figure content. The system developed first analyzes the figures and the text to build indexes of their content and figure-text interrelations. Visually based interactive systems for users are built that allow them to drill-down to specific information in individual papers, starting with high-level exemplars. The project uses 10,000 or more papers from the Open Access publisher, BioMed Central. This allows all the resulting knowledge bases and systems to be freely distributed, unimpeded by copyright issues. The methods for doing this are extensions of the PI&amp;apos;s successful Diagram Understanding System amended to use clustering and modern machine learning techniques such as boosting. The approach to text is equally novel. The text patterns are discovered by automated information-theory-based techniques combined with computational linguistics. The patterns are collected into a Framework Bank, much in the tradition of WordNet, FrameNet, the Proposition Bank, and the Gene Ontology. Users of the systems can range from students to researchers and may include the general public, with its growing interest in biomedical research results. The heavy involvement of undergraduate students in Computer Science and Biology, including women and minorities, will continue to inspire them about careers in research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A long standing dream of Artificial Intelligence has been to create an&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;autonomous learner that continuously increases its knowledge by&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;reading a wide variety of texts. To date, this kind of knowledge&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;acquisition has been attempted only rarely, and typically at small&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;scale. Yet the Web has made a vast library of online text readily&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;accessible. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In response, this project investigates a family of unsupervised,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;domain-independent, scalable systems that learn from the Web in an&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;open-ended fashion. Such systems not only extract information but&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;also extend their ontology, incorporating new classes and relations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Furthermore, the systems&amp;apos; learning is recursive -- once new relations&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;are learned, the system builds on these to learn new relations,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;relations between relations, and so on. The project investigates the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;automatic control of this process, and analyzes both the power and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;limitations of this form of learning.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will impact both the natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) communities&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;by investigating fundamental issues in learning from text. In&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;addition, the systems developed could lead to a new generation of Web&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;search engines that improve information access, achieving a broad&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;societal and economic impact.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Iowa State University is awarded a grant to launch PLEXdb (Plant Expression Database), a unified, MIAME-compliant public resource for large-scale plant gene expression data. Currently, there is no resource in the plant community that integrates the rapidly expanding number of gene expression profile data sets with traditional structural genomics and phenotypic data. The goal for PLEXdb is to provide the electronic framework for such community effort. Users will perform hypothesis-building queries from multiple interlinked sources, e.g. a particular gene, a protein class, EST entries, physical or genetic map position - all coupled to parallel expression data from a variety of crop and model plant species. Data will be linked to analytical and biological functions (e.g., BLAST, spliced alignment, multiple alignment, regulatory motif identification, and expression analysis). User feedback will be solicited via the web and through connections of the PIs with the user community and incorporated into the database interface. As a result of this integrated national and international effort, analysis of high-throughput parallel expression experiments will help build intelligent hypotheses for a new generation of functional experiments. PLEXdb will provide an essential public resource that serves as a bridge from sequence to trait ontology through transcript (and eventually protein and metabolite) profiling. The underlying premise is that these molecular level phenotypes manifest as traits plant breeders select for and will lead to improvements in food and nutrition. Through active participation in the NSF-NIH Bioengineering and Bioinformatics Summer Institute (BBSI) in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Iowa State University, science-bound undergraduates will be involved who may not have the opportunity to participate in research at their home institutions, particularly from underrepresented groups. Outreach to secondary school students will include hosting grade 7-12 biology teachers in our laboratories for summer internships through the NSF-RET program. PLEXdb is a multi-disciplinary project that will provide graduate students and postdoctoral researchers opportunities to mentor undergraduate and teacher interns.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor is awarded a grant to further develop Organelle DB, a Web-accessible relational database compiling a supplemented listing of organelle-localized proteins and major protein complexes. Organelle DB houses data for 25,000 proteins from 154 organisms spanning the eukaryotic kingdom. Each protein in Organelle DB is presented with its subcellular localization, protein sequence and, as available, a detailed description of its function (as culled from corresponding model organism databases). To facilitate data interoperability, all protein localizations are annotated using controlled vocabulary from the Gene Ontology consortium. Organelle DB is also a significant repository of biological images, providing roughly 1500 micrographs of yeast cells carrying stained proteins. Organelle DB is freely accessible at organelledb.lsi.umich.edu. At present, Organelle DB is a cross-species and cross-discipline resource consolidating our knowledge of the proteins comprising eukaryotic organelles and subcellular structures; however, it holds the potential to be much more. Organelle DB can serve as a channel through which we can provide an integrated knowledge base of orthologous data sets related to protein localization, while fostering the use of standardized data formats and the development of graphical interfaces for the visualization of biological data in non-text-based formats. In this award Organelle DB will be integrated with relevant external databases. Orthologous data sets from protein-protein interaction studies will be integrated with protein localization data in Organelle DB through links to and from the BIND database. Images of eukaryotic proteins visualized by live cell fluorescence microscopy will be incorporated into Organelle DB using the standardized data structure of the Open Microscopy Environment (OME). Organelle View, a prototype interface for the visualization of localization data in a non text-based format, will be made accessible through Organelle DB. Organelle View is envisioned as a particularly useful resource in the instruction of younger students (e.g., high school biology students and college undergraduates), introducing them to complicated concepts in cellular and molecular biology through an interface that is visually arresting and &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot;.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)/Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)/Collaborative Research project is to explore how industry and academia can collaborate to determine how multiple sources of resources can be combined to impact proactive obsolescence of electronic parts through forecasting and management. One of the most significant problems facing many &amp;quot;high-tech&amp;quot; sustainment-dominated systems is technology obsolescence, and no technology typifies the problem more clearly than electronic part obsolescence. It is expected that substantial savings in resources are possible if methods of forecasting through obsolescence-driven life cycle planning of products were developed and applied. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will involve three high risk, high impact activities:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) Forecasting electronic part obsolescence by predicting the date of discontinuance under uncertainty of social, political, economic, and environmental factors.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) Determine the best mitigation approach upon obsolescence, and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) Manage the redesign of systems based upon the forecast.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact is the expectation that longer term cost avoidance can be a more significant driver in economic decision-making if the forecasting lowers the uncertainty and risk. This is a high risk activity because of the inherent complexity is integrating across social and technological models for a sector such as the electronics sector.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Although service-oriented environments and technologies are receiving a great deal of attention in both academic and corporate arenas, the ability to automate the discovery and composition of such services into higher-level capabilities remains elusive. This is funding to support an international web service discovery and composition competition, the WS-Challenge, whose objective is to identify, evaluate and baseline approaches to solving that problem. Building on the success of the first competition (The EEE05 Challenge, which was held this past March in Hong Kong), the PI will organize the planning and enactment of the second competition to be held in conjunction with the 2006 IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce, and e-Services (EEE 06) which will take place in San Francisco next July. The first competition was limited to syntactical matching using the Web Services Description Language (WSDL); participants were required to identify and compose WSDL-specified services based on their input and output messages as specified in a directory of WSDL documents. In 2006, the competition will focus on the semantic linking of web services using such technologies as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and/or the Web Ontology Language for Services (OWL-S). NSF funding will support participation in the competition of up to 8 teams from the United States, consisting on average of 3 students apiece. A small portion of the funds is earmarked for two undergraduate students who will support the competition throughout the year, as well as to cover the cost of travel by them and the PI to the competition.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The IEEE International Conferences on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service bring together researchers and developers from diverse areas of computing. The conferences provide a venue for developers and practitioners to explore and address challenging research issues surrounding e-technology, in order to develop a common research agenda and vision for e-commerce and e-business. The focus is two-fold: to investigate enabling technologies to facilitate next generation e-transformation; and to disseminate application and deployment experience in e-themes such as e-business, e-learning, e-government, e-finance, etc. The EEE conferences are particularly timely and relevant because they focus on the application of electronic services as they cut across several &amp;quot;e-domains&amp;quot;, whereas other conferences tend to either focus on a specific technology or on a single domain.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: The workshop and resulting artifacts will serve as a centralized repository of algorithms, software, and techniques in a timely emerging area. The workshop will provide participants with an opportunity to gain exposure in the community for their innovative work, and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community. It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. The workshop experience will integrate well with the goals of a software engineering education, as participants are evaluated on their design in addition to the performance of their approaches. In an effort to engage a broader audience in next year&amp;apos;s event, the PI will make a special effort to solicit teams from under-represented universities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Abstract - Title: Process Connectors: Enabling Rapid and Flexible Interconnection of Distributed Processes&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Poor coordination of interacting processes in the construction industry is largely responsible for a low workflow reliability of 30-60% that results in costly delays and repeated process coordination needs in this $700+ billion dollar US industry ($3.4 trillion globally). However, since the coordination needs are information intensive, new computer science practices supported by detailed understanding of the application domain holds the promise to improve practice. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project objectives are to generate new theory and understandings to enable rapid configuration of computerized links - process connectors - between firms to manage distributed process coordination tasks. A key limitation of existing models and methods for integrating distributed services (e.g., Web Services) is that they do not provide the necessary tools to rapidly configure specific implementations (particularly for complex services). This limits their usability in projects where firms assemble and disassemble in an ad hoc manner. To support the research objectives, two specific outcomes are anticipated: (1) Development of an ontology that can accommodate interactions between processes, in particular interactions where there are different levels of detail and constraints that must be propagated across processes. (2) Development of a specification language to flexibly model heterogeneous processes and process connectors in an executable format. To guide the development and testing the research team will collaborate with industry throughout the project. Specific focus will be placed on residential construction, a large $300+ billion subset of the US construction industry. Collaboration with industry provides directed opportunities to foster the educational objectives of the grant to involve students in the research and to develop examples and systems for classroom pedagogy. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;While focusing on residential construction, the theory and methods developed under this proposal are applicable to a wide range of project industries such as commercial and industrial construction, shipbuilding, custom manufacturing, etc. More broadly, the proposed research will provide the foundation to enable dynamic process modeling by firms and individuals. It is expected that the proposed research will enable a step change in firms&amp;apos; capabilities to share process knowledge and coordinate their collective actions, allowing them to generate, evaluate and refine process alternatives more rapidly and reliably than is currently possible.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Representation is a central construct in the creative process. Exploring alternate representations can significantly increase the quality of artifacts created, and using multiple representations enables creators to broadly consider the multifaceted nature of the problem spaces they explore. Narrative offers an ideal laboratory for investigating multiple representations in the creative process because stories can be expressed in rich text (a static, uni-modal representation) re-represented in animated stories with accompanying narration and spoken dialogue (a dynamic, multimodal representation). The objective of the proposed research is to design, build, and empirically evaluate an interactive creativity environment that facilitates the exploration of alternate representations in the creative process. In particular, the proposed work will focus on the Narrative Theatre, an interactive narrative-centered creativity environment.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will yield a cognitive account of creativity that will inform the design of next-generation creativity environments. By promoting rich interactions that are simultaneously effective and engaging, it will find broad application in education and training technologies. The project will increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities. It will involve a diverse population in the Narrative Theatre user studies, it will involve women in all aspects of the research, it will train undergraduates through involvement in formal and informal research exposure efforts, and it will increase the participation of women and underrepresented groups in computer science through interaction with the STARS Alliance.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Intellectual Merit: University of Arizona proposes a multidisciplinary research program addressing an important technological challenge: the incompatibility of RF and optical communication technologies due to the large bandwidth mismatch. Another important outcome is development of novel modulation and coding techniques enabling reliable communication under strong atmospheric turbulence. The specific goals of the proposed research program include: (i) Development of efficient interfaces to enable the hybrid RF-free-space optical transmission including orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and multilevel pulse-position modulation; (ii) Development of efficient modulation techniques capable of operating under strong atmospheric turbulence, including the multi-laser-multi-detector concept; (iii) Development of efficient coding techniques, such as low-density parity-check codes, to improve the reliability of the free-space optical system; (iv) Development of refined system models and channel capacity studies to assess the ultimate performance limits; and (v) Experimental validation of the proposed methods. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impact: By combining the theoretical expertise in coding, modulation, and free-space optical communications, with the numerical-modeling expertise and state-of-the-art experimental infrastructure, the Principal Investigators are in a unique position to develop a new generation of hybrid RF-free-space optical systems, contributing therefore, significantly to the evolution of optical network technologies and the information infrastructure in the United States and abroad. The interdisciplinary nature of the project (i.e., combining optical physics, optical device technologies, and communication/coding theory and practice) is expected to foster cross-disciplinary education, and to create new opportunities for students to obtain industry internships and therefore enhance collaboration between the University and industry. The main educational objectives include: (i) establishing a graduate seminar for dissemination of new information on free-space optical communications, (ii) developing a new graduate course entitled ?Free-Space Optical Communications,? (iii) incorporating iterative decoding techniques into the Digital Communications Systems course-sequence, and (iv) publishing a chapter or a monograph on modulation and coding for optical communications.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This grant will support the development of a novel Web-based visual semantic query system and a bottom-up semantic integration method to enhance the geospatial data search capability of the multi-agency Federal Web-based geospatial data portal, Geospatial One Stop (GOS). The efficiency and accuracy of data search will be increased with a searchable global view of semantically heterogeneous geospatial attributes. The results can be employed to other geospatial data portals and applications that need a solution to semantic integration. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is interdisciplinary, involving GI Science, information science, and domain knowledge and will add visual semantic query functionality to geospatial portals and provide bottom-up semantic integration using local semantics without the need of an upper ontology or standardized terminology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Impact&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broadly, this research will contribute to geospatial data integration that is an essential (but missing) component of the U.S. National Spatial Data Infrastructure. With GOS as a collaborator, a variety of users from both the public and academic community can benefit from the project results, e.g. emergency response and management activities that need a large amount of geospatial data.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This CAREER project poses the fundamental question of how can cyber-tools and cyber-environments better enable learning in the engineering disciplines. The theoretical framework for this work is a synthesis of situated learning theory and theories of semantic web (a new and evolving area of study in computing that has major implications for future cyber-tools and cyber-environments). While situated learning theory focuses on the student experience, theories of semantic web design focus on the process of characterizing and creating cyber-environments. The specific goals of this project include: (1) understand educators&amp;apos; expectations of cyber-tools and cyber-environments as engineering teaching tools; (2) characterize how undergraduate learners interact with the current generation of simulation tools online; (3) investigate the influence of learning styles on undergraduate students&amp;apos; use of simulation tools; and (4) create and validate a learner-centric semantic schema- also called ontology - to form the foundation for the creation of future simulation cyber-tools. Integration of research and education occur will through the development of an online &amp;quot;Guide to using cyber-environments in the undergraduate engineering curriculum&amp;quot;. This research will lead to the creation of highly adaptive and customizable learning experiences when using cyber-tools and cyber-environments as part of the engineering curricula.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Modeling complex real world problems in the national and homeland security domains require multi-disciplinary thinking and utilize multiple analytical approaches to represent massive numbers of entities, their behaviors, and the emergent interactions among them. As such, the traditional approach to building comprehensive, requirements-driven simulations does not work for such problems. This project uses a Society-based Approach to Integration using a ?shared but self-managed? paradigm, wherein, autonomous members collaborate in a society while sharing only a part of their knowledge. Component simulations self-assemble into realistic synthetic environments. The self-assembly of simulations is achieved through a domain-specific ontology, simulation specifications, and semantic matching between diverse members. New members join an existing society or an existing member modify its interaction needs without requiring the society to reconfigure. Using knowledge discovery, each member determines what aspects of entities in the society to interact with. In this way, a society is automatically configured into a synthetic environment. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts of this project include: creation and deployment of large scale synthetic environments by bridging new and existing models and simulations from diverse disciplines; leverage knowledge generated by the wider DDDAS community in creating complex synthetic environments at scales and diversity much greater than the state-of-the-art; facilitate rapid integration across diverse systems and paradigms, such as, discrete event simulations with agent based simulations, in a semantically consistent manner; and develop open source technology that will benefit the community at large with broader application to simulation based engineering, education, and decision analytics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Interdisciplinary (99) An interdisciplinary course of biologically inspired design (BID) is being developed for joint enrollment of upper level undergraduates from engineering and biology undergraduates. Using the organismal world as a guide, students are creating solutions to real world problems that have been subjected to traditional engineering methods. The overall course objectives are to:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; 1) Develop strategies for teaching BID that facilitate collaborations between biological scientists and engineers at the earliest phases of their educational careers. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; 2) Identify and examine case studies of BID in various fields as a way to identify common principles and approaches, and identify critical areas that require coordination among different practitioners of biologically-inspired design. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; 3) Devise project-based and problem-based exercises to bring together students in the fields of science, engineering, and design to facilitate the incorporation of biological principles into engineering design. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; 4) To familiarize scientists and engineers with challenges that are amenable to biologically-inspired approaches. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The course is being integrated into both the biology and engineering curricula by cross listing it in biology and several engineering majors. The cross listing is removing barriers to the fulfillment of graduation requirements since it is an upper division elective and offers the same contribution toward graduation as any other elective upper division disciplinary course.</Abstract>

It is common to find curricula in the arts (music, graphical design), business (accounting, economics), sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), and social sciences with computational courses in their curriculum. In the one year of this project, the workshops will focus on identifying the scope of the similarities and differences among these communities and in identifying ways in which the computing community can best serve the entirety of the expanded community. The project will begin the integration of the computing ontology into the organization of curricular materials and the use of social software to deliver essential information. A centralized website will provide RSS feeds with news about computing education, blog entries about computing education, links to resources, and other community oriented information (e.g., conference calendars). Workshop participants will include faculty from all of the computing disciplines, industry representatives, students, and faculty from disciplines we do not usually think of as computing intensive.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Quantum mechanics has been one of the most significant and arguably the most profound of fundamental developments in physical theory in this century. Quantum mechanics has affected virtually every branch of physics, other basic sciences including chemistry and biophysics, and modern technology. It has literally helped to revolutionize the world in which we live and the way in which we view or understand that world. At the most fundamental level, our conception of the universe has been transformed from the deterministic world of classical physics to an indeterministic one. This picture arises not directly from the equations or formalism of quantum mechanics proper, but from the standard or &amp;quot;Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. There does, however, exist a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics that is claimed to be as empirically adequate as the generally accepted orthodox one. Such a theory requires considerably less drastic departures from or revisions of the epistemology and ontology of the classical physics community. Under this research grant, Professor Cushing will be examining why this causal approach to quantum mechanics has not been accepted. The reasons for the rejection of causal quantum mechanics involves both substantive, scientific reasons &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; to the science itself as well as &amp;quot;external&amp;quot; sociological reasons. In this study, Professor Cushing will be determining both the internal and external factors which have led to the rejection of a causal quantum mechanics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Expressed sequence tags (EST&amp;apos;s), are short nucleotide sequences determined from the cDNA copy of mRNA in a given cell, tissue, organ, or organism. EST&amp;apos;s are widely used and equally widely generated, providing information about gene identity, expression and distribution for a wide range of organisms. Although it is relatively easy to generate the sequence information of an EST, there are a number of problems associated with storing and using the information. The software platform proposed here integrates a database, a biological ontology, or structured language, and sequence analysis functions for an EST knowledge base. This knowledge base addresses three problems faced by a biologist: storage of the data, analysis and archiving of the results, and integration into a cumulative database. The system is designed to permit a typical biologist to install and operate it. In order to do this, the system will provide user-friendly interfaces for additon of sequences, automated running of assembly and analysis programs, a query and alert system for complex searches, and a data sharing arrangement for geographically separate laboratories to permit integration. As a prototype, a knowledge base on the chicken will be developed. This is particularly useful since the chicken is often used as a comparative species for contrasting with mammals such as mouse and human. In developing the system, a range of training opportunities will be offered to undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral scientists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Abstract: Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) promotes new mechanisms and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;methods to improve separation of concerns in software design. AOP is not&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;well understood in theory, and remains controversial among researchers and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;practitioners. One issue is that it relies on implementation-dependent,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;implicit side effects, contradicting traditional views on abstraction,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information hiding, and compositional reasoning. The PIs&amp;apos; goals are to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;explicate fundamental mechanisms of AOP; assess and improve the impact of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;AOP on decomposition and coupling; and improve our understanding of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;inherent complexity of, and potential for, compositional reasoning involving&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;AOP. The approach is to ground AOP in an underlying ontology of implicit&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;invocation and then to leverage knowledge in that domain to advance our&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;understanding of AOP. The intellectual significance of the proposed work is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in its potential to improve our understanding of AOP, including effects on&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;modularity and abstraction, and the complexity of specification and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;verification. Broader impacts are anticipated to flow from regularized and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;improved AOP mechanisms, e.g., for event abstraction. The project will also&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;support development and delivery of a senior-level undergraduate and early&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;graduate course on AOP.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The use of Web services revolutionizes the way that many e-commerce, consumer software, scientific computing, and telecommunications applications are provided. The key to realizing the full potential of the Web services paradigm will be automated discovery, composition, analysis, and monitoring of web services. Achieving this requires advances in many aspects of computer science, including programming languages, data management, workflow, transaction management, distributed computing, knowledge representation and automated reasoning. This project provides key foundations and advances in data and information management needed for success of the Web services paradigm. This project expands on existing work to develop models of the semantic and behavioral characteristics of web services. The automata-based models can specify a &amp;quot;behavioral signature&amp;quot;, that represents abstractions of both the &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; behavior of individual Web services and the &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; behavior of Web service compositions. Using semantics, behavior and I/O signatures, the project develops new approaches to automated composition, and studies global properties of compositions, including characterizations of the global behavior and static analysis of how data is passed and manipulated. It also lays the foundations for the query languages and frameworks useful in supporting automated web service discovery and composition in a scalable context. In addition to the study of formal models, the research develops various software tools that will be available via the project&amp;apos;s Web site (http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~su/NSF0415195/). The resulting formalism will improve the quality of deployed web services since properties of their behavior can be verified, and foster web service adoption and reuse since compositions of services could be synthesized and analyzed. This is a collaborative university (Jianwen Su, University of California, Santa Barbara)/industry (Rick Hull, Lucent) research project. This will facilitate transferring the theoretical results to practice and finding realistic applications to test the techniques. The project exposes students and academic researchers to industry needs and industry practitioners to university research through a plan of mutual visits.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The project is a study of Kant&amp;apos;s justification of Newtonian science. It shows how Kant&amp;apos;s justification of Newtonian science is a justification not of the fundamental principles of Newton&amp;apos;s Principia, but rather of Newtonian science, that is, how Newton&amp;apos;s Principia was received in 18th century Germany. Given the rich array of ways in which various figures attempted to come to terms with Newtonian science, the project illustrates how Kant&amp;apos;s attempt at justifying Newtonian science most closely resemble projects by those with significant interests in metaphysics (e.g., Leibnizians such as Wolff, Knutzen, Gottsched). Kant sees the need to develop non-empirical justifications of Newtonian principles and to articulate an ontology that is compatible with Newtonian physics (given his rejection of Newtonian absolute space and time). The results of this project should benefit anyone interested in the history of philosophy of science, the history of science, and the history of philosophy, and, in general, to those interested in understanding the complex relations among natural science and philosophy.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from is directed at demonstrating the feasibility of using Information Extraction, a computer technology based on Natural Language Processing, to selectively extract key information from the running text of synthetic procedures. Synthetic procedures are batch recipes used in the creation and discovery of new chemical entities for drug discovery. The ultimate aim of the project is to automate information extraction and place the information in a computer- understandable data structure that fully captures the content and semantics of the synthetic procedure. Such data structures dramatically increase the value of synthetic procedures since they allow development and deployment of software applications that automate many common time-and labor-intensive tasks in chemical synthesis. The objectives of this Phase I research project are to design and prototype critical software elements of Information Extraction. Feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated by using the developed elements to automatically perform some common tasks that currently require manual intervention by a chemistry expert. Demonstration tasks will include the following: automated creation of synthetic procedure domain ontology; creation of list of materials; and automated text extraction rule induction.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;There are recipes for more than 19 million unique chemical compounds reported in the public literature. There are a comparable number in the archives of pharmaceutical companies. Overwhelmingly, these procedures are maintained as unstructured running text. IntelliChem&amp;apos;s proffered extraction of synthetic procedure information into computer-understandable data structures enhances the value of a procedure, promotes information reuse, and provides a basis for automating many time- and labor-intensive tasks in chemical synthesis. The proposed system will also provide insights into the automated linguistic analysis of semistructured text in other domains that are sufficiently narrow and well organized, and thus it would be generalizable for many other potential applications and uses.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Gene flow is the successful movement of genes from one population to another. Crop gene flow is the result of both natural processes like wind dispersal of pollen and human processes like the planting of seeds in fields. Theoretical and empirical studies have focused on gene flow at the local and landscape scale, but they generally have neglected gene flow on the global scale. The controversy surrounding the unintended movement of engineered genes (transgenes) has raised awareness that new alleles can move rapidly and over great distances. No models have emerged to evaluate the spread of crop transgenes through both natural and human processes over time and space, nor have human impacts on gene flow been explored yet. This interdisciplinary research project will focus on the development of an integrated model to describe the dynamics of dispersal of a new crop transgene in space and time. A benefit of focusing on transgene flow is that it affords examples of alleles whose age and origins are known. The model will evolve with iterative interactions between three research teams. The initial model will use corn (Zea mays, maize) in the U.S. and Mexico as a model system, but the model eventually will be adapted for other crop systems, such as canola. Furthermore, the project will move beyond the initial two-nation focus to explore transgene spread at the global scale. One research team will have the construction of the model as its primary assignment. The model will start with a structure of simple natural dispersal processes. The other two teams will make conceptual contributions for refining the model, such as (1) natural processes that affect dispersal patterns like wind directionality, timing of plant flowering, and the spatial distribution of cross-compatible wild relatives, and (2) human processes that affect dispersal patterns like farmer management and choice of seeds for replanting or transport of seed through local and international trade. Those teams will also contribute novel data and pre-existing data from the literature for modifying and testing the model. The teams then will evaluate the refined model for (1) natural impacts, such as the evolution of weediness or the loss of biodiversity in wild relatives, and (2) human impacts, such as evolution of trade policy in response to unintended transgenes in the food supply or changes in traditionally based agricultural systems precipitated by the presence of transgenes in local varieties. New gene-flow influences resulting from these consequences will then be incorporated into the model. Examples include (1) the spatial spread of the transgene into expanding weed populations and (2) international trade barriers or changing labor migration patterns. The evolutionary results from the model will be compared with real spatial and temporal changes in corn transgene frequencies in Mexico. Regular meetings of the research teams will serve to improve the integrative model while providing new opportunities to scrutinize the constraints and consequences of dispersal. The final product will be a global model that can be generalized to describe for the spread of any plant allele as constrained by human and natural processes.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will have significant implications for predicting plant gene dispersal under natural and human dispersal. It will thus have implications for the spread of invasive organisms as well as for its focus of transgene flow. The topic of transgene flow is a part of the greater public discussion of genetic engineering. The results of the project will have direct relevance to addressing critical issues like the unintended spread of engineered genes that have been reported occurring adventitiously in non-engineered crop varieties, in Mexican corn despite a multiyear moratorium against planting transgenic corn in that country, and in natural populations. The results of this study therefore will provide that scientific input to inform both lay audiences and policy makers at both the national and international levels. The project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2004 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many environmental observations are collected at different space and time scales that preclude easy integration of the data and hinder broader understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Ocean Observing Systems provide a specific example of multi-sensor systems observing several variables in different space - time regimes. This project integrates diverse space-time environmental sensor streams based on the conversion of their information content to a common higher-level abstraction: a space-time event data type. The space-time event data type normalizes across the diversity of observation level data to produce a common data type for exploration and analysis. Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GOMOOS) data provide the multivariate time and space-time series from which space-time events are detected and assembled. Event detection employs a combined top down-bottom up approach. The top down component specifies an event ontology while the bottom up component is based on extraction of primitive events (e.g. decreasing, increasing, local maxima and minima sequences) from time and space-time series. Exploration and analysis of the extracted events employs a graphic exploratory environment based on a graphic primitive called an event band and its composition into event band stacks and panels that support investigation of various space-time patterns.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project contributes a new information integration approach based on the concept of an event that can be extended to many domains including socio-economic, financial, legislative, surveillance and health related information. The project will contribute new data mining strategies for event detection in time and space-time series and a set of flexible exploratory tools for examination and development of hypotheses on space-time event patterns and interactions.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This is the first year of funding of a 4 year continuing award. The goal of this project is to help machine learning make the leap from today&amp;apos;s one shot, standalone applications to the ubiquitous, continuously functioning, seamlessly integrated web of learning systems of the future. The work will focus on four thrusts that are necessary to bring this about: (a) Scaling up machine learning algorithms so they can be applied to very large databases, and developing intrinsically scalable new algorithms; (b) Increasing the autonomy of learning systems through the use of automated data integration and improved overfitting avoidance; (c)Enabling learning systems to handle, data from heterogeneous sources and with different types of structure, such as the World Wide Web; (d) Educating a new generation of scientists to take advantage of the methodologies and tools provided by machine learning. If successful, the proposed work will lead to an order of magnitude or more increase in the size of databases to which machine learning algorithms can be usefully applied, to a significant reduction in the level of expertise required to develop and deploy a learning system, to learning systems that are able to function in environments of a greater variety and complexity than is currently the case, and to a new crop of scientists who are able to perform analyses that are currently beyond their reach with corresponding increase in the potential fornew discoveries and innovations.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Research in search techniques was a critical component of the first generation of the Web, and has gone from academe to mainstream. A second generation &amp;quot;Semantic Web&amp;quot; is being built by adding semantic annotations that machines can understand and from which humans can benefit. Modeling, discovering and reasoning about complex relationships on the Semantic Web will enable this vision and transform the hunt for documents into a more automated analysis enabled by semantic technology. The beginnings of this shift from search to analysis can be observed in research and industry as users look beyond finding relevant documents based on keywords to finding actionable information leading to decision making and insights. Large scale semantic annotation of data (both domain-independent and domain-specific) is now possible because of an accumulation of advances in entity identification, automatic classification, taxonomy and ontology development, and metadata extraction. The next frontier, which fundamentally changes the way we acquire and use knowledge, is to automatically identify complex relationships between entities in this semantically annotated data. Instead of a search engine that returns documents containing terms of interest, there will be a system that returns actionable information (with the associated sources and supporting evidence) to a user or application. The user interacts with information universe through a hypothesis driven approach that combines search and inferencing, enabling more complex analysis and deeper insight. The research will focus on the design, prototyping and evaluation of a system, called SemDIS (Semantic Discovery) that supports indexing and querying of complex semantic relationships and is driven by notions of information trust and provenance and models of hypotheses and arguments under investigation. Such a capability greatly enhances the capacity of intelligence analysts to obtain (in time) information leading to a more secure homeland and world. Corresponding to the breadth and depth of the topics involved in the challenge undertaken, this is a collaborative project involving researchers at UGA&amp;apos;s LSDIS lab and UMBC. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;SemDIS will have broader impacts beyond the education and training of graduate students, and the publication of research findings. Results from the research will be integrated with courses, both existing and new. Institutional mechanisms in place will seek participation of students from underrepresented groups. The work will also gain from several academic-industry collaborations of the investigators. There will be an opportunity to leverage commercial infrastructure and raw metadata provided by Semagix. The researchers will collaborate with industry, and the students will be encouraged to intern at collaborating industrial labs. Within a broader social context, emerging knowledge-centric technologies raise legitimate privacy and civil liberties concerns.

<Abstract>This project will develop novel methods for the statistical analysis of the evolution of social groups acting within a large social network via a communications network, such as the Internet. The basis for the analysis is a set of probabilitistic laws (micro-laws) that govern the individual behavior of actors, which largely determines the macro-evolution of the social groups. The parameters of the macro-evolution can be measured and then used to determine, via reverse engineering, the parameters of the micro-laws that fit the observed evolution. Understanding the evolution of social communities will help determine resource allocation strategies for enhancing the functioning of these communities. The methods developed in this research can be used to locate, within a large social network, social groups that try to hide their inner communications. Such a system can be instrumental in preventing terrorists&amp;apos; attacks similar to those on September 11, 2001. The proposed research will also open up novel educational opportunities at the home university related to social network analysis.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research objective of this award is to determine the cognitive differences of different engineering design methods. The understanding of engineering design based on scientific evidence is still in its infancy. The approach is to utilize protocol studies, under development in design cognition, using on a principled coding scheme founded on Gero?s Function-Behavior-Structure ontology of designing. Individuals will be taught a range of design methods. Design teams will be formed and given open-ended design tasks. Design teams will be studied using the protocol method while employing one of the taught methods. The resulting design proposals will be evaluated. The protocols will be segmented and coded using the principled coding scheme. The resulting codings and the ensuing linkographs will be analyzed for cognitive structures using statistical techniques including clustering and Markov chain analysis. In addition, entropy analyses of the linkographs and the change in entropy over time will be calculated. The results from these analyses will form the basis of the comparison of the cognitive differences between the engineering design methods studied. A correlation between engineering design cognitive behavior and design outcomes will be carried out. Deliverables will include: empirical data on engineering design behavior in the form of videos of design sessions of teams using different design methods; transcriptions of the design sessions; coded data; linkographs; and the results of the analyses. These represent different levels of granularity from data through to highly processed information.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide support for a science of engineering design by providing a principled method and a base of results that can be utilized to compare methods and models. The award will demonstrate analytical techniques for the analysis of engineering design protocols using engineering design domain knowledge, techniques which can be used across the entire domain of engineering design. The results will provide the foundation for the evaluation of engineering design tools and techniques.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Simple contagion processes underlie various phenomena on complex networks, such as the spread of diseases on social-contact networks and information in communication networks; understanding their dynamics and developing control mechanisms are key issues in numerous applications. The goals of this proposal are: (i) Developing methods to construct synthetic relational networks using partial and noisy data; (ii) Understanding the structure of these networks and the contagion processes, and especially important network properties and typical patterns that have an impact on the dynamics of contagion; (iii) Developing techniques to control the spread of contagion processes, and to detect, prevent and arrest cascading failures in coupled socio-technical networks; and (iv) Understanding the co-evolution between the networks and dynamics, and using this to refine their models, and the strategies to control them. The broader impacts of this work include bridging the gap between the social sciences and computer science in addressing fundamental questions in complex networks, a corresponding enhancement to course curricula, and the involvement of students at all levels.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Today people make novel uses of social networking and other internet software to respond to tragic events in creative and dynamic ways. Since shortly after the April 16, 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, this research group has integrated digital library, data and text mining, information visualization, and social network analysis techniques to help with understanding and recovery from this tragic school crisis. This proposal is meant to research and develop a next- generation domain specific digital library software suite, the Crisis, Tragedy and Recovery (CTR) -toolkit, building upon 17 years of work on digital libraries, as well as expertise in information retrieval, data and text mining, database management, human-computer interaction, and sociology. Advanced intelligent information integration methods have not been sufficiently applied to this domain. The impact of events is felt over extended periods, requiring longitudinal perspectives to understand their complexity and inter-dependencies. Consequently, with the Internet Archive and other partners, the group will begin to create CTRnet, an integrated distributed digital library network for providing a rich suite of CTR-related services. Such work will help ensure that further tragic events might be better understood and prevented.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This CAREER project poses the fundamental question of how can cyber-tools and cyber-environments better enable learning in the engineering disciplines. The theoretical framework for this work is a synthesis of situated learning theory and theories of semantic web (a new and evolving area of study in computing that has major implications for future cyber-tools and cyber-environments). While situated learning theory focuses on the student experience, theories of semantic web design focus on the process of characterizing and creating cyber-environments. The specific goals of this project include: (1) understand educators&amp;apos; expectations of cyber-tools and cyber-environments as engineering teaching tools; (2) characterize how undergraduate learners interact with the current generation of simulation tools online; (3) investigate the influence of learning styles on undergraduate students&amp;apos; use of simulation tools; and (4) create and validate a learner-centric semantic schema- also called ontology - to form the foundation for the creation of future simulation cyber-tools. Integration of research and education occur will through the development of an online &amp;quot;Guide to using cyber-environments in the undergraduate engineering curriculum&amp;quot;. This research will lead to the creation of highly adaptive and customizable learning experiences when using cyber-tools and cyber-environments as part of the engineering curricula.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Abstract - Title: Process Connectors: Enabling Rapid and Flexible Interconnection of Distributed Processes&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Poor coordination of interacting processes in the construction industry is largely responsible for a low workflow reliability of 30-60% that results in costly delays and repeated process coordination needs in this $700+ billion dollar US industry ($3.4 trillion globally). However, since the coordination needs are information intensive, new computer science practices supported by detailed understanding of the application domain holds the promise to improve practice. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project objectives are to generate new theory and understandings to enable rapid configuration of computerized links - process connectors - between firms to manage distributed process coordination tasks. A key limitation of existing models and methods for integrating distributed services (e.g., Web Services) is that they do not provide the necessary tools to rapidly configure specific implementations (particularly for complex services). This limits their usability in projects where firms assemble and disassemble in an ad hoc manner. To support the research objectives, two specific outcomes are anticipated: (1) Development of an ontology that can accommodate interactions between processes, in particular interactions where there are different levels of detail and constraints that must be propagated across processes. (2) Development of a specification language to flexibly model heterogeneous processes and process connectors in an executable format. To guide the development and testing the research team will collaborate with industry throughout the project. Specific focus will be placed on residential construction, a large $300+ billion subset of the US construction industry. Collaboration with industry provides directed opportunities to foster the educational objectives of the grant to involve students in the research and to develop examples and systems for classroom pedagogy. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;While focusing on residential construction, the theory and methods developed under this proposal are applicable to a wide range of project industries such as commercial and industrial construction, shipbuilding, custom manufacturing, etc. More broadly, the proposed research will provide the foundation to enable dynamic process modeling by firms and individuals. It is expected that the proposed research will enable a step change in firms&amp;apos; capabilities to share process knowledge and coordinate their collective actions, allowing them to generate, evaluate and refine process alternatives more rapidly and reliably than is currently possible.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Last Modified Date: 06/13/09 Last Modified By: Christina L. Bloebaum &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Abstract &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research objective of this award is to investigate two novel research approaches to understanding and managing technology obsolescence challenges: (1) a knowledge representation scheme and management system that can facilitate information sharing and collaboration for obsolescence management and mitigation efforts between existing tools and across different organizations; and (2) fundamental principles, teachable methods, and guidelines for designing product architectures that can evolve with changing requirements, enabling proactive obsolescence management across the entire product life cycle. Fast moving technologies have caused commercial high-tech components to have shortened procurement life cycles, rendering them obsolete quickly. The impact and pervasiveness of obsolescence problems are growing. Existing work focuses on reactively managing obsolescence, i.e., minimizing the cost of resolving the problem after it has occurred, however, reactive management is very expensive and inefficient. Proactive and strategic obsolescence management have many potential advantages, but are poorly understood in theory, and poorly addressed in practice. Deliverables include a standard obsolescence ontology within a software system that domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields, demonstration and validation of fundamental principles on a wide range of product design problems, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for underprivileged undergraduate students. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the results of this research will overcome limitations in existing design methods that do not adequately consider obsolescence issues. This research will provide a platform for the exploration and understanding of interactions among the elements of product design and sensitivities to obsolescence. Designers will have the tools they need to manage the issue of obsolescence and design products to enable proactive obsolescence management. The results of this research will be disseminated to provide an opportunity to create cost-effective, and environmental friendly products at faster pace. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. The education and outreach activities of this effort will help promote interest for engineering from underrepresented groups.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research creates an innovative method for visualizing and analyzing space-time dimensions of the spread of ideas through semantic webs represented in texts posted on the Internet and the Web pages. The project integrates geographic information systems (GIS), geographic information science (GIScience), computational linguistics (CL), and semantic web (computer-based ontology) technologies to track and analyze public-accessible websites for progressively more defined clusters of words and phrases that characterize actual and potentially developing networks of social processes. Human and natural crises (e.g., epidemics), and hostile social movements (e.g., militia and hate groups) are examined as illustrative exemplars of the utility of such an integrated system. Website pages and web contents with identified clusters of words or phrases will be mapped (by geo-referencing their web addresses, URL, place names, gazetteers, blogs, etc.) over a world map (using GIS tools) with time stamps. The resulting map provides a visual ?information landscape? consisting of hundreds of website locations (using real world coordinate systems) containing related keywords or similar ideas. When integrated with time-series analyses, this map allows the examination of the paths and speed of information dissemination, as well as the evolving varieties of various ideas and their relationships. By creating a Semantic Web Automatic Reasoning and Mapping System (SWARMS) prototype, researchers can visualize the spread of concepts, ideas and news over time and space. Clusters of keywords and phrases are identified and classified, and references to key ideas, provocative events, and important text sources are collected. This innovative methodology can be applied in multiple languages and other applications, such as cellular phone text messages and social network messages (such as twitter messages).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit: This project forms a new multidisciplinary research framework in connecting social science and computer science for analyzing the dynamic information landscape on the Internet in which ideas spread quickly. By combining GIScience and geo-locating skills in a Web search mechanism, this project illustrates a new approach to information query, retrieval, and analysis methods. The creation of semantic knowledge bases upgrades traditional ?data mining? methods to advanced ?information mining? approaches. This research facilitates the development of space-time analysis methodology, a rapidly growing field in the context of the traditional separation between time series analysis and spatial analysis. The innovative semantic and spatiotemporal analysis framework provides a new direction for social science research to track the spread of ideas, to analyze where they go and how fast, and to analyze the ideological, social, and religious conditions that promote that spread. There are numerous current for- and non-profit organizations as well as government organizations that routinely monitor the web for various purposes. The unique aspect of this project, however, is that it brings together disparate academic disciplines not only to monitor the web, but also introduces a coherent methodological framework to analyze the spread of an idea and its impact through cyberspace.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: This project helps to foster the integration of research and education in multiple disciplines, including geography, linguistics, political science, and communication. Four graduate students at SDSU are directly funded and trained through this project. Students across a variety of disciplines and curricula also directly benefit from this research project. This research provides an excellent opportunity to involve students from diverse backgrounds. San Diego State University is ranked number 8 in the nation for bachelor?s degrees awarded to Hispanics and number 11 for bachelor?s degrees awarded to all ethnic minorities, and was ranked number 22 in the nation for ethnic diversity by U. S. News and World Report in 2006. Given the makeup of the student body, this project features underrepresented groups in both graduate and undergraduate programs. The project website publicizes research findings to the general public and creates a discussion forum to involve multidiscipline researchers. Four Cyber-Discovery and Information Landscape workshops are planned to facilitate future multidisciplinary collaborations. This research improves understanding of the technical, psychological, and political mechanisms and conditions that facilitate the spread of certain ideas and provide a new direction for social science research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Recent technological advances have produced large data sets of protein-protein interactions (PPI). These data are often presented as graphs where nodes represent proteins and edges indicate the linkage between proteins with experimental support. This representation reveals that PPI networks are non-randomly organized, but unfortunately offers little insights on the dynamic nature of protein interactions inside the cell. The goal of this project is to develop generic methods for exploring the dynamics of PPI networks using human platelet cells as target and by integrating various information sources, with the eventual goal of being able to identify novel signaling pathways and networks in human platelets.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In this project a new graph model will be developed for capturing the dynamic nature of protein-protein interaction in the following manner. (a) Each node is not an individual protein but a protein-protein pair and each node is labeled with terms representing contexts in which the interaction should be observed. Each interaction node will be mapped to a real vector of fixed dimension using amino-acid sequence similarity and co-evolution as basis spectral clustering as a mapping tool. (b) Based on gene ontology, groups of interaction nodes will be presented as hyper-edges over the nodes. (c) The problem of inferring interaction will be translated as the problem of assigning labels to each node. (d) The label assignment problem will be solved as a label-ranking problem combined with a label number predicting problem. (e) The method will be validated using wet-lab experiments with human cells and human platelet data. Computational tools will be developed using the high-performance computing facility in the Center for Computational Science at the University of Miami. Undergraduate and high school students from the underrepresented groups will be actively recruited. Courses on computational biology and on chemical biology will be developed and taught at the University.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Computer science foundation-building courses at the freshman and sophomore levels pose the greatest stumbling blocks to undergraduate students&amp;apos; learning. CS student enrollment has declined over 60% nationwide, even though the demand for skilled professionals was increasing. There is an urgent need for a more effective CS learning model. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The main purpose of this research is to enrich the context of the CS learning process which is important from motivational and educational perspectives. This project investigates a verification-driven learning model that facilitates students&amp;apos; involvement in real-world computing tasks starting from their early computing courses and continuing throughout their entire studies in computing. This model can significantly reduce the prerequisites for students to study real-world problems in their early years. The students are tasked to validate the functionality of software, execute programs, test parts of systems (pre-decomposed subsystems and components), and locate possible errors. Such seemingly complex high-level tasks can be done by novice students because software verification does not require design and implementation, and can be turned into a learn-by-example process with adequate preparation. This kind of preparation is wrapped in a Verification-Driven Learning Case, which defines the configuration to support a verification-driven learning activity, and consists of elements such as the justification of the system&amp;apos;s existence, the requirement specification, description of the functionality, a set of test cases, and the decomposition of the system. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The foundation of the verification-driven learning model lies in software testing theories and techniques. Frequent and progressive exercises on verification will prepare the students for formal specifications. To realize the learning model, this project will produce Learning Cases based on faculty research including computer security, bioinformatics, geographic information systems, database and data mining techniques, remote sensing, and fuzzy set techniques. The Learning Cases will expose the students to working software systems that serve a real-world purpose in scientific research, engineering development, or social networks.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will particularly advocate computer science education in under-represented minority and woman students. This learning approach will also help adult students who have rich experience in various areas but need to reposition themselves in the work force. The final goal of this project is to revitalize the CS programs and produce more competent graduates capable of computational thinking.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This IGERT project will continue the doctoral education and research training program in Geographic Information Science (GIScience) at the University at Buffalo, and expand it into new research areas. GIScience is an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the nature of geographic phenomena and of geographic information, providing theoretical foundations for Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIScience seeks to formalize geographic principles using logic and mathematics, to explore scientific, educational, and policy-related uses of geographic information, and to elucidate the complex relationships that individuals and society have with GIS. It also provides a framework for scientific and engineering studies of physical and social phenomena. GIScience underpins the multi-billion dollar GIS industry in the United States, including its many applications relevant to national security and to the economy, and to science and engineering.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The scientific core of the project focuses on research in three major interlocking areas. The first research theme is basic geographic information science, which includes ontology of the geographic domain, cognitive geography and geographic cognition, human interaction with geographic information and technology, and geographic information, institutions, and society. The second research theme is geographic environmental science, which integrates spatial databases with regional models to forecast the environmental effects of phenomenon such as groundwater contamination and volcanic flows. Geographic social science is the third research theme, and is based on the integration of spatial analysis and spatial statistics with GIS, addressing topics such as the development of new methods for the detection of hot spots in patterns of phenomena such as disease or crime, and of better methods for intelligent highway systems. The educational and training aspects of the program are centered on four core courses, including a new required core course in ethics and professionalism. Students will also be required to have competence in the use of GIS software, and a basic understanding of the mathematical foundations of the field. The program also includes cross-department research experiences, internships (including international research internships), and an international summer school. The international summer school will be open to early-career scholars in GIScience from other US institutions, broadening the impact of the IGERT-funded graduate research training beyond this institution. Over the next five years, the program will have a new funding pattern: trainees will be funded for two years as NSF Fellows, and for two years on university-based enriched assistantships. This is an important step toward institutionalization, since toward the end of this funding period we will argue for the long-term continuation of university support. Five additional years of external support will allow completion of the institutionalization of the program, producing a lasting effect on the culture of graduate education within the participating departments and beyond. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in its attention to innovative research in environmental science, social science, information science, and engineering. The project will continue to foster interdisciplinary sharing of ideas and research methods, and continue to influence the work of both faculty and students involved in the program. This influence will extend well into the future as the trainees enter the workforce. The broader impacts of the proposed activity will come from the integration of social and natural science research to produce policy recommendations for decision-makers. The program will develop broadly prepared Ph.D.s with multidisciplinary backgrounds who will have a significant impact on the further development of the field both nationally and internationally, in academia, government, and industry.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In this sixth year of the program, awards are being made to institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Poor coordination of interacting processes in the construction industry is largely responsible for a low workflow reliability of 30-60% that results in costly delays and repeated process coordination needs in this $700+ billion dollar US industry ($3.4 trillion globally). However, since the coordination needs are information intensive, new computer science practices supported by detailed understanding of the application domain holds the promise to improve practice. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project objectives are to generate new theory and understandings to enable rapid configuration of computerized links - process connectors - between firms to manage distributed process coordination tasks. A key limitation of existing models and methods for integrating distributed services (e.g., Web Services) is that they do not provide the necessary tools to rapidly configure specific implementations (particularly for complex services). This limits their usability in projects where firms assemble and disassemble in an ad hoc manner. To support the research objectives, two specific outcomes are anticipated: (1) Development of an ontology that can accommodate interactions between processes, in particular interactions where there are different levels of detail and constraints that must be propagated across processes. (2) Development of a specification language to flexibly model heterogeneous processes and process connectors in an executable format. To guide the development and testing the research team will collaborate with industry throughout the project. Specific focus will be placed on residential construction, a large $300+ billion subset of the US construction industry. Collaboration with industry provides directed opportunities to foster the educational objectives of the grant to involve students in the research and to develop examples and systems for classroom pedagogy. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;While focusing on residential construction, the theory and methods developed under this proposal are applicable to a wide range of project industries such as commercial and industrial construction, shipbuilding, custom manufacturing, etc. More broadly, the proposed research will provide the foundation to enable dynamic process modeling by firms and individuals. It is expected that the proposed research will enable a step change in firms&amp;apos; capabilities to share process knowledge and coordinate their collective actions, allowing them to generate, evaluate and refine process alternatives more rapidly and reliably than is currently possible.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will develop tools that make it possible to retrieve naturally occurring sentences from the World Wide Web on the basis of lexical content and syntactic structure, providing linguists with an immediate, easily accessible source of raw linguistic data. The PIs will investigate specific linguistic hypotheses at the lexical semantics/syntax interface as an illustrative application of these tools. At a high level, the planned work constitutes an important step toward a new paradigm for linguistic research. Rather than relying entirely on introspective data generated by the linguist who is trying to (dis)prove a particular hypothesis, Web-enabled linguistics research will draw on the methodology and the tools developed by the PIs to supply naturally occurring data on which theories can rest. With regard to specific linguistic questions, the goal is to provide an explanation of the rules and constraints that govern three transitivity alternations (Middle, Unaccusative, Unspecified Object Deletion), and the PIs expect data made available by their tools to shed light on the &amp;quot;grey&amp;quot; area between competence and performance, that is, the linguistic behavior that seems to fall outside of rule-governed behavior. Although naturally occurring data are not accorded great emphasis in generative syntax, the use of text corpora has a tradition in the greater linguistic enterprise. An explosive new phenomenon in the world of naturally occurring text, the World Wide Web is an essentially untapped resource that embodies the rich and dynamic nature of language, presenting a data resource of unparalleled size and diversity</Abstract>

<Abstract>A team of institutions is developing the technical capabilities and executing the organizational responsibilities of the core integration component of the National SMETE Digital Library program. Collaborators include: UCAR, Cornell University, Columbia University, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval at the University of Massachusetts, and the San Diego Supercomputing Center. The project is bringing together many efforts already underway, and engaging new efforts as well, in support of a comprehensive large-scale digital library that promises to enhance every aspect of education in science, mathematics, engineering and technology. The organizational and technical underpinnings of the proposed work fall into three categories of effort, each within the overall context of educational excellence: 1) engaging the community, 2) providing technology, and 3) operating core services. To promote the vision of a strong NSDL community that sees itself as owning the program and having major influence on the character of the library, the project team is working with all NSDL-funded projects, helping to integrate their work into the library. Additional partnering with efforts such as those funded by the NSF&amp;apos;s Digital Library Initiative and by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and independently developed collections and services, is also taking place. Development and support of models for intellectual property and digital rights management are being undertaken, as well as promotion of a library evaluation framework, administration of an NSDL program advisory group, and development of an overall governance mechanism for the NSDL. A robust, flexible information technological infrastructure is being implemented based on two themes: a spectrum of interoperability and &amp;quot;one library with many portals&amp;quot;. Technical components include a flexible portal architecture, a central metadata repository, an open source tool kit for access to rich content, and a database for authentication and user profiles, all emphasizing openness and long-term evolution. Finally, support is provided for a very wide array of educational and library services, emphasizing in this initial phase: operation of the primary portal and specialized portals for the NSDL community and the NSDL partners, comprehensive information retrieval services to search for collections or individual items, and an optional service for user profiles and authentication. The other two awards in this collaborative project are 0127308 and 0127520.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The ultimate goal of this research is to integrate visual and computational descriptions of complex metabolic and regulatory networks to aid biologists in evaluating hypotheses for how these dynamic networks function under different conditions. These networks will combine graph models from pathway databases, text-mining programs, machine learning systems, and other sources, together with multiple classes of experimental data. The unique features of the proposed graph visualization and analysis platform are: 1) Evaluation of the structural effects of dynamic links that change depending on time and other conditions. 2) The ability to immediately integrate current research hypotheses with available published results to evaluate their impact and explanatory power. 3) Interactive display of large metabolic and regulatory networks in either user- or automatically selected levels of detail. 4) Creation of visual graph display tools specifically designed for improved biological network display, comparison, and analysis. As part of this process, significant problems in the analysis of variable graph structures, incremental graph layout, and effective visualization and labeling will be addressed with an interdisciplinary focus. The software will be open source and freely available to academic institutions. It will be evaluated and validated using three interrelated but only partially understood signal transduction networks: ethylene, jasmonate and salicylic acid. These pathways interact complexly to direct specific plant defense responses to stress. The software will contribute to the research community&amp;apos;s open source software toolbox by providing more effective ways to visualize and manipulate graphs. By actively integrating biologists in the design and development we will ensure practical applicability and usability for non-computer-expert users. Education and outreach activities will promote research, K-12 and undergraduate education, and dissemination of results to a broad audience, while developing a new generation of scientists that employ the powers of computers to their fullest to advance all sciences.</Abstract>

<Abstract>PROPOSAL: 0830618&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;INSTITUTION: Univ. of Maryland&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI: Samet, Hanan&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;TITLE: Scalable Geometric and High Dimensional Data Structures and Algorithms: A Parallel and Distributed Approach&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ABSTRACT&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The steadily decreasing cost of commodity computing as well as the democratization of the increasing thirst for computing power, fueled largely by the massive volumes of data generated by powerful search engines, has led to a reexamination of how the traditional methods of solving problems that involve search. As more and more applications become web services (i.e., ``cloud applications&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in technology parlance), there is an increasing expectation that answers be obtained and provided in real time and at a scale that is capable of servicing millions of users at the same time. For many complex problems, this expectation forces a rethink of the solution paradigm. In particular, there is an increasing realization that the speed and scale requirements mean that the only way to provide the service is to decouple the solution process into two steps: one that precomputes a solution space to all possible problems, and possibly provides an encoding of it, and one that navigates the solution space. This research explores the decoupling paradigm in the context of answering shortest path and nearest neighbor queries in a spatial network, where the effect is to decouple the process of computing shortest paths along the network from the process of finding the nearest neighbors.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research aims at increasing the accessibility to massive amounts of user generated data including maps, documents, videos, images, and music by speeding up the similarity searching task. This invariably involves taking advantage of ways to sort the data which also includes developing methods to build appropriate multidimensional and spatial indexes. By focusing on making use of GPUs and distributed processing, as well as decoupling via pre-computation, it brings the benefits of this increase in computing power to a wider range of users who often have this power at their disposal. In addition, by demonstrating the power obtained by the use of decoupling in computing nearest neighbors in a spatial network it stimulates the development of scalable solutions to other search problems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Artemov, Fitting, and Nogina will continue their development of Justification Logic, which offers a possible breakthrough in the quest to create a fundamental theory of knowledge, belief, and evidence, and has the potential for significant impact on applications. The celebrated account of knowledge as &amp;quot;justified true belief,&amp;quot; which is attributed to Plato, has long been a focus of epistemic studies. About a half-century ago, the notions of knowledge and belief acquired formalization by means of modal logic. However the notion of justification, an essential element of epistemic studies, was conspicuously absent, and this led to well-known deficiencies inherent in modal logics of knowledge.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Justification Logic extends the logic of knowledge in three major ways. First, it adds a long-anticipated mathematical notion of justification, making the logic more expressive. We now have the capacity to reason about justifications, simple and compound. We can compare different pieces of evidence pertaining to the same fact. We can measure the complexity of justifications, thus connecting the logic of knowledge to a rich complexity theory, etc. Second, justification logic furnishes a new, evidence-based foundation for the logic of knowledge, according to which `F is known&amp;apos; is interpreted as `F has an adequate justification.&amp;apos; Third, justification logic provides a novel, evidence-based mechanism of truth tracking which can be a valuable tool for extracting robust justifications from a larger body of justifications which are not necessarily reliable.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Knowledge, belief, and evidence are fundamental concepts whose significance spans many areas of human activity: computer science and artificial intelligence, mathematics, economics and game theory, cryptography, philosophy, and other disciplines. Justification Logic promises significant impact on the aforementioned areas. In particular, the capacity to keep track of pieces of evidence, compare them, and select those that are appropriate would be a valuable new tool.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Recent large-displacement experiments with simulated gouge indicate that velocity-dependence of gouge friction evolves to, and out of velocity weakening behavior, dependent upon cumulative slip history. Such rate-dependence transitions appear to coincide with certain shear localization and delocalization microstructures. Do the microstructures appear and disappear in a systematic way with cumulative displacement? The PI&amp;apos;s propose to investigate the question through specific models with built-in tendency for shear localization and recurrent delocalization. In one model the state of gouge is determined by interaction of shear bands and surfaces at the scale of gouge thickness, in another the observed rate-dependence transitions result directly from grain-scale processes. They will investigate the validity of the models in both simulated and natural fault gouge. Simulated gouge samples will be produced by a series of rotary shear experiments; natural gouges will be collected from previously studied San Gabriel and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Punchbowl fault outcrops in southern California. The rate-and state-dependent friction laws are to a large extent empirical expressions of the processes of cataclasis, healing, and development of internal structures in gouge. Microstructural parameters known to control these processes include particle size, particle size distribution, gouge layer thickness, porosity, and gouge fabrics. The coupling between microstructural and mechanical analysis is weak due to difficulties in working with randomness, variability, and discontinuity that is inherent in brittle deformation microstructures. Do cataclastic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;microstructures offer significantly more information than have been acquired so far by traditional methods? The PI&amp;apos;s propose to use digital image techniques, which allow matrix-type manipulations of image data and application of statistical, massive and sequential data analyses. They believe that the project has clear implications for the physical definition of the evolution laws in friction constitutive equations, laboratory-to-field scaling relations, and computer simulation of gouge evolution. Furthermore, large-scale fault mechanics investigations (e.g. SAFOD) are expected to benefit from the portability and efficiency of digital image techniques that will be developed by this project.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Nebraska EPSCoR, in cooperation and collaboration with research universities in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the state of Nebraska, seeks to build research infrastructures in several areas of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;informatics. The effort will be directed at three primary areas that are consistent&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;with the Nebraska EPSCoR Strategic plan as well as plans and strategic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;directions of the participating universities including: (1) development of wired and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;wireless network technologies that will more effectively link ongoing inter-campus&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;efforts within a secure distributed information infrastructure, (2) development of a&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;test-bed to research next generation Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;systems architectures that are viable and efficient for e-commerce through&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;collaboration with the private sector, (3) development of inter-campus capabilities&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in newly emerging research areas of bio-informatics and computational biology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed infrastructure initiative in informatics complements the developing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information technology industry in the state, involves scientists and engineers&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;from four university campuses (University of Nebraska, Lincoln (UNL), University&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of Nebraska Medical Center, University of Nebraska, Omaha (UNO), and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Creighton University. It provides for an integrated plan to accomplish goals that&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;are considered crucial for establishing competitiveness in computational-based&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;informatics research within the state of Nebraska. In addition to the major&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;development effort for the interdisciplinary informatics infrastructures, the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;proposed project will greatly enhance the computational capabilities available to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;a broad range of fields of research and instruction.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Additional components of the project will support educational activities and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;research experiences for underrepresented groups, internships for science and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;technology students to work in private industry, a small grants program for faculty&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;early in their careers, technical assistance and faculty travel, and outreach to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;other Nebraska colleges and universities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this research project is to develop agent-based systems--for electronic commerce, automated manufacturing, or supply-chains, for example--where the agents adapt their behaviors so as to maximize their individual rewards. A general predictive theory is developed, which can determine expected emergent behaviors from initial agent capabilities and interaction protocols. A methodology for the engineering of utility-based adaptive multi-agent systems is derived from these studies. Finally, the theories are applied to the development of an incentive-compatible information exchange protocol and its implementation in a prototype information exchange multi-agent system. Information serves as a currency in the protocol, and its value is determined via the agents&amp;apos; adaptive behavior. The aggregate of all the users&amp;apos; knowledge, opinions, and biases are immediately accessible to all users. Such research is critical to begin to predict the emergent behavior of systems and to move in the direction of integrating multi-agent systems theory and practice. New graduate curricula with an emphasis on decentralized systems and an undergraduate course on agent-based software engineering will be developed.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Information systems are now mobile, wearable, multimodal, real-time, scalable from workstations to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;desktops to notebooks to palmtops to cellular, collaborative and ubiquitous. Network access is becoming&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;increasingly important as a part of the computing infrastructure. Unfortunately, for the near term, un-limited bandwidth, anytime access to a network is not feasible, particularly in large urban environments&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;where interference, occlusion and collision are ongoing problems. To alleviate this, we are developing a&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;set of context-aware Autonomous Information Retrieval (AIR) pods. These are small, hardened low-cost&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;computers that require only electric power. AIR pods have sufficient local storage to hold relatively static&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information and are equipped with two wireless interfaces: one short-range, unlicensed high-speed interface&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;such as IEEE 802.11 and one long-range, low-speed interface such as CDPD or other Wide Area Network&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;connection which may be intermittent. AIR pods can be either stationary or mobile. Stationary AIR pods&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;can be attached to lamp posts and traffic lights, hidden in lighted store signs or in subway stations. Mobile&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;AIR pods can be attached to delivery trucks, postal service vehicles, buses, police cruisers, taxis or other&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;vehicles that roam city streets. AIR pods are also small enough to be carried in backpacks.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; We propose to develop and implement the prototype hardware and software AIR idea, and explore what&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;kinds of infrastructure support are necessary to make these devices a key component of network applications.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Research issues addressed will be cooperative data sharing, resource scheduling and anticipatory caching,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;message propagation and wide-area resource discovery.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The proposed mobile networking infrastructure will be tested in a demanding set of context-aware mo-bile research projects. The first project is a wearable augmented reality system that allows outdoor users to tour a campus interactively. A second related project allows indoor users to collaborate with those outside over wireless networks. The third project is a mobile robot sensing system that can autonomously explore the campus and create rich 3D, texture mapped, site models. All of these applications need to interact with host computers through limited network access, and we propose to optimize this interaction over bandwidth, devices, and locality using context-aware wireless networks.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Sequential and graph-structured data arise naturally in a wide variety of scientific, engineering, and intelligence problems, such as handwriting and speech recognition, text mining, gene finding, and network analysis. While researchers have recently made significant progress on machine learning methods for processing structured data, these methods are much less accessible to scientists, engineers, and analysts than the better understood statistical learning techniques of classification and regression.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is researching methods to advance the state of the art in machine learning for structured data, building on recent work in conditional random fields and weighted transducers. The project is also developing a software toolkit to make the results of these advances accessible to researchers working in a wide range of disciplines and application domains. The toolkit will enable users to define, train, and apply models for structured data without requiring advanced expertise in machine learning. The functionality of the toolkit will include methods for specifying features relevant to an application, automatically selecting the most relevant features, adjusting parameters to optimize suitable training objectives, and combining models that pertain to different facets of an application.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The software, which will be freely distributed, will be tested with selected users in several application domains, and be carefully documented. The project will thus provide the scientific and engineering community with the first generally usable tool for learning from structured data, serving a role that is parallel to that of the more standard tools for classification and regression that are already widely used.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project provides much needed data and tools for analyzing innovations of all possible outcomes, included failed innovations. This approach overcomes the bias in the science policy which studies only popular or ultimately successful innovations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit: This comprehensive endeavor enables SciSIP researchers to build and test theories that explain the differentiated trajectories of science and technology innovations and their associated communities. The project also spans disciplinary boundaries by bridging the artificial divide in SciSIP research between the production and the use of innovations, piecing together a holistic view of the dynamic supply and demand in the innovation ecosystem. Specifically, the project builds a large-scale, multi-source, longitudinal database, Science &amp;amp; Technology Innovation Concept Knowledge-base (STICK), and develops a set of visual analytic tools for monitoring and understanding the emergence and revolution/evolution of innovations in three exemplar science and technology fields: information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The knowledge-base captures innovations, the individual and organizational actors associated with the innovations, and the relationships among the innovations and the actors through a hybrid approach that combines computational analysis of text (e.g., natural language processing) and social information processing (e.g., social tagging and collaborative writing by the users of the knowledge-base). State-of-the-art visualization tools are customized for SciSIP researchers and other innovation stakeholders to visualize innovation networks and analyze patterns and trends. The design of the knowledge-base and toolset is grounded in a demonstration study on the popularity of innovations. The study aims to address important questions concerning the complex relationships among innovations and the evolution of communities, with implications to the popularity and ultimate success of innovations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: STICK is institutionalized at the University of Maryland at College Park as a free public service that offers web access to the data and tools developed in this project. This service also produces quarterly reports on the status of science and technology innovations, including the National Innovation Popularity Index, analogous to the Consumer Confidence Index for the state of the economy. This research-based service is an intuitive tool for science and technology education. For most fields where specialization is the theme, students&amp;apos; and the public&amp;apos;s interests increase with the capability to monitor and make sense of the fast-changing arenas where innovations emerge, converge, and diverge. For scientists and engineers, STICK&amp;apos;s visual analytic toolset helps accelerate scientific discoveries and innovations by identifying and establishing collaborations within and across innovation communities. Finally, STICK helps science and technology policy makers monitor and understand the evolutionary paths of innovations, appraise the significance of innovations in rigorously charted terrains, and proactively foster, promote, and advance innovations with benefits to the society.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal presents a new approach to improve data preservation and accessibility ? the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) Project ? a comprehensive plan for fleet-wide data management. R2R will be a central shore-side data gateway through which underway data from each expedition are routinely cataloged and transmitted from UNOLS ship operators to long-term national archives. R2R will provide essential data documentation services including the production of standardized cruise-level metadata, data inventories, navigation products, and an operations report for every expedition. Tools for routine logging of over-the-side sensor deployments and sampling stations will be developed and deployed to facilitate creation of a sampling ?event log? for each cruise. In partnership with the Shipboard Automated Meteorological and Oceanographic System (SAMOS; http://samos.coaps.fsu.edu/) Data Assembly Center (DAC), R2R protocols will be established for near real-time transfer and automated Quality Assessment (QA) of meteorological and thermosalinograph data providing direct feedback to operators while the cruise is underway. R2R will coordinate the development of routines for post-cruise QA of underway data types, with initial development focused on geophysical sensors (multibeam sonar, subbottom profilers, magnetics, gravity), and subsequent expansion to other sensors (CTD, ADCP, etc). Using R2R tools, underway data will be categorized and sufficiently documented for submission to long-term National Data Centers (NDCs) operated by NOAA, and to DACs specialized in the reduction and analysis of specific data types. Our approach will be to leverage and augment the existing centralized information resources of the UNOLS office, ship operators, and NDCs to facilitate the documentation and delivery of oceanographic data from ?rolling deck? to ?repository.? Our vision is that working directly with ship operators and technicians will ensure more complete and consistent acquisition, quality, preservation, and dissemination of these high-value data, thereby transforming the academic fleet into an integrated global observing system. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: Access to research vessels is becoming increasingly more expensive and difficult. The R2R project will help to leverage these costs for the benefit of the entire ocean science community and any other potential users of the data that will be routinely collected, checked and properly archived. As the proposers state, this will essentially make the UNOLS fleet an observatory system that will have coastal, regional and global scope, providing data sets useful to current and future researchers. Going forward with this project, even though it may seem expensive will in the long run make our investment in the research vessels, instrumentation and operational costs much more cost effective.</Abstract>

<Abstract>An emerging activity of digital educational repositories is the cross-referencing of resources with national and state standards. The goal of QuEST (Quality Estimate Scoring Technique) is to provide a cross-referencing support system to greatly increase the productivity of the expert human cross-referencer so vastly more resources can be matched with higher accuracy. This mechanism uses information found in NSDL&amp;apos;s Strand Maps for both characterization and discrimination analysis to support the scoring of a resource to a particular Strand Map benchmark. QuEST is providing a working cross-referencing support system that can be plugged into any partner digital repository. It is transforming the cross-referencing task from a strictly concept matching effort to a truly representative comparison of what is important to educators. This is reducing the burden on teachers by providing a better filtered set of resources that have been selected based on quality markers used by teachers.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;By cross-referencing useful content more quickly and effectively, teachers are able to find and select more appropriate content which in turn is helping them deliver high quality education to their students and achieve higher personal satisfaction. This is also leading to greater utilization of the repository. QuEST also supports the NSDL mission by functioning as a learning environment for its project participants, including undergraduate and graduate students, teachers, and librarians. Through their exposure to the larger evaluation and software development components of QuEST, project participants gain increased understanding of the overall digital repository research process.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project combines new design representations and computational approaches to enable computational conceptual design. The design representations and computational methods leverage the constant increases in computational power and information retrieval reasoning algorithms. Descriptive methods, stored knowledge, and algorithmic reasoning provide the potential for a computational theory of conceptual design that could greatly benefit the designer during difficult stages of concept generation. The underlying theme is the combination and formalization of function-based synthesis, constraint management and state space search. The primary objective of the work is to create a computational theory of conceptual design that can compute design alternatives. The computation will result in a comprehensive space of concept variants and search it for feasible candidates.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The activity of concept generation is one of the cornerstones of engineering design. Until recently, the only resources available to a designer during conceptual design were personal experiences and innate abilities. While the designer&amp;apos;s resources have advanced significantly in the last three decades, there is still a lack of continuity between computational design tools and conceptual design methods. Many formal methods of conceptual design have yet to be realized as computational algorithms. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research will develop representations and computational methods that allow design concepts to be created from the functional description of a needed product. Through the development of a design knowledge repository and a concept generator that uses the stored knowledge, this research extends the current understanding of the relationship between function and form and codifies it. Also, novel component representations enable computers to determine component compatibility and thus synthesize a concept variant. Additionally, this work is useful for comparison to human design behaviors, as it is built on commonly used design practices.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This work is both basic and practical in nature. Thus, the broader impacts extend beyond publication to the usage of the resultant knowledge, methods and tools in education, engineering practice and research. For example, students will be able to use the concept generator to create solutions that, because of their limited experience, they might otherwise not have developed. These solutions will expose students to different disciplines and engineering and scientific domains. The results of this research impact industry and research in a similar manner. In both cases, the research can be used to generate a broader array of solutions much more quickly than would have been possible without it.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many programmers, instructors, and programming students have a strong intuitive belief that visualization is valuable for communicating information about the state and behavior of programs. In particular, in the area of algorithms and data structures, traditionally regarded as a core area of computer science that students find difficult, the advent of algorithm animation created great expectations in the CS teaching community, as animation was seen as a better way to portray the dynamic workings of algorithms than was the use of purely static media. However, an apparent disconnect exists between the prevalence of a belief in the usefulness of visualization and the extent to which visualization is actually employed. In this project, the PIs will investigate the hypothesis that present PV systems have failed to live up to expectations because they have largely ignored the issue of appropriate perceptual properties for effective viewing, and that in order to be effective PV systems must support perceptually appropriate animation, graphical design and layout, as well as good pedagogical design. In order to address this problem, the PIs will identify and evaluate perceptual, attentional, and cognitive aspects of program visualization and will quantify and categorize these results. They will perform observational studies of how instructors teach in order to identify the tasks that instructors perform in preparing and presenting visualization-based lesson, and will develop improved presentation and interaction techniques for program visualization and more generally for process visualization. The PIs expect that critical evaluation of the effects of relevant attributes of PVs, the development of metrics for quality of PVs, and the tuning and evaluation of models based on these metrics through empirical studies, will serve to provide normalizing parameters for future studies of the benefits of program visualization. More importantly, this work will serve as the basis for design guidelines for the effective use of PV and other forms of process visualization.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: This project will advance the state of knowledge in human-computer interaction and perceptual psychology; will provide design guidelines applicable to program visualization and process visualization in particular, with potential benefit to all viewers of such displays (students, scientists, and the general public); will engage both undergraduate and graduate students in research in both computer science and perceptual psychology; will include participants from under-represented groups (the PIs students include African Americans, Asians, and women); and will result in publications that will appear in journals and conference proceedings, and in software and evaluation metrics that will be disseminated through the web.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The main research objective of this proposal is to develop a formal theory of distributed ontologies for use on the Semantic Web. The theory defines the semantics of relationships that can exist between ontologies and those that can exist between ontologies and information resources. The theory will be developed in phases: a model theoretic semantics with different entailment relations for each point of view will be followed by a possible world semantics that unifies the various entailment relations. It will then be extended to allow for rich expressions of trust. Scalability, an important issue for the Semantic Web, will be a significant consideration in the design of the theory. Results from this project would impact other areas as well, for instance, communication between autonomous agents and distributed databases. The educational component of this project focuses on using the Semantic Web as a tool for education and for the training of semantic web practitioners and future researchers. Resources from the project will be used in a course and will be made available for use by other educators.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Internet revolution has led organizations worldwide to rely heavily on information sharing over the Internet to conduct their daily business. Information sharing on the Internet usually occurs in broad, highly dynamic network-based environments, and formally accessing the resources in a secure manner poses a difficult challenge. Our focus is on the problems of secure information exchange and secure information access in Internet-based collaborative environments. The research objectives are as follows. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Secure group communication. In collaborative work and research environments, group members must be able to set up a reliable, secure information sharing and communication medium among them. Techniques will be developed for setting up secure group communication and providing a set of accesses to group members for a variety of digital data in highly dynamic networks.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Security services. Digital information in database systems generally represents sensitive and confidential information that organizations must protect and allow only authorized personnel to access and manipulate them. The research will address the issue of how to advocate selective information sharing in role-based systems while minimizing the risks of unauthorized access proposing a delegation framework. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework through policy specification, enforcement, and a proof-of-concept implementation.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL) are two &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;primary international organizations in the field of natural language &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;processing and language engineering. For over forty years, the two &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;organizations have sponsored conferences to facilitate the exchange of &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;research ideas. This year, the two organizations will co-host a joint &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;conference from July 17th to July 21st, 2006, in Sydney, Australia. It &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is the major international conference for the field. This award &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;subsidizes the expenses for students selected to participate in the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Student Research Workshop associated with the main COLING-ACL &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;conference. The students-only workshop allows participants to present &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;their research and receive feedback from a panel of established &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;researchers in the field. The forum provides students the opportunities &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to gain exposures to external perspectives on their work at a critical &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;time in their professional development. The intimate format encourages &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;students to begin building rapport with established researchers. The &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Student Research Workshop contributes to the maintenance and development &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of a skilled and diverse computational natural language workforce, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;helping to produce a pool of future researchers for Natural Language &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Engineering. The workshop encourages a spirit of collaborative research, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and builds a supportive environment for a new generation of &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;computational linguists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>In the proposed research, highly reliable memories made of unreliable components will be developed&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and characterized in terms of their complexity and ability to retain the stored information. The main challenge is that in nano-scale systems both the storage elements and logic gates are faulty. It is in contrast to the state-ofthe- art systems where only the memory elements are considered unreliable while error correction encoders and decoders are assumed to be made of reliable logic gates.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The set of problems that will be addressed in this research can be condensed into the following question:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;given n memory cells and m universal logic gates which fail following a known random mechanism, what is the optimal memory architecture which stores the maximum number of information bits for the longest period of time with arbitrary low probability of error? This complex problem can be divided and reformulated in many ways, but, interestingly, even some of the most fundamental questions related to this problem are still unanswered. The most important question is related to the following two fundamentally different approaches in fault-tolerant memories: (i) To improve reliability, the logic gate resources may be invested into a von Neumann multiplexing scheme. In this way, one can build highly redundant reliable networks that simulate the function of universal logic gates, and then use such better gates to build an error correction encoder and decoder. (ii)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Alternatively, the logic gate resources may be invested into building a more powerful error correcting code (i.e.,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;decoder) capable of handling both memory elements as well as logic gates errors. Which of these two&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;approaches is optimal for a given failure mechanism? On a broad scale, is it better to deal with a reliability issue on a device or on a system level?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The unique feature of the nano-systems that both the storage elements and logic gates are unreliable makes the problem of ensuring fault-tolerance theoretically very important, because the process of error correction is not error-free as assumed in classical information theory. Making error correcting codes stronger and transmitters and receivers more complex will not necessarily improve the performance of a system. It is likely that for a given failure mechanism, there is a trade off between receiver complexity and its performance.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Our approach to developing fault-tolerant memory architectures is based on a method developed by&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Taylor and refined by Kuznetsov. Taylor and Kuznetsov (TK) showed that memory systems have nonzero&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;computational (storage) capacity, i.e. the redundancy necessary to ensure reliability grows asymptotically&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;linearly with the memory size. Two fundamental open problems that will be addressed in this research are&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;determining storage capacity of nano-scale memories and the development of capacity approaching fault-tolerant architectures. The equivalence of the restoration phase in the TK method and faulty Gallager-B algorithm (as explained in Project Description), will enable us to tackle these and other important problems in reliable storage on unreliable media using the large body of knowledge in codes on graphs and iterative decoding gained in the past decade.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impact:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This program will contribute significantly to the evolution of data storage technologies and the information&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;infrastructure in the United States of America and abroad. Another important aspect is the establishment of a&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tight interdisciplinary integration of knowledge in coding and signal processing, and nano-scale devices and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;subsystems into programs benefiting undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Arizona and the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;industrial technical research community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project, facilitating the development and execution of complex software applications (such as the seamless, fault-tolerant integration of wired and wireless health care networks), proposes the development of an Arkansas Intelligent Coordinating Entities Emulab at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. The emergence of new large-scale application domains combined with new distributed computing scenarios such as ad-hoc, mobile, peer-to-peer, and pervasive computing techniques motivate the need for novel approaches to support complex software applications. In critical situations, embedded hardware and software elements in the applications are resource-constrained and power limited devices. Effective coordination of these distributed elements is often contextual, and often strictly related to the environment in which they reside. However, dynamically changing group structures and environments require a configurable, flexible, scalable, and easy to use computing environment that supports composition and dynamics of free-ranging aggregates. The lab permits quick set-up of experiments that scale with minimal effort and are repeatable under different parameters. Emulab offers the flexibility to change parameters and network scenarios, allowing repeatability. Supporting research activities that include health-related projects, the infrastructure enables common net-centric research training and industrial collaboration. The project addresses the following problems: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Intelligent Communication and Coordination of Sensor Networks; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Implantable Antennas, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Advanced Bio-Electromagnetic Modeling and Simulations and Telecommunications Applied to Wireless E-Health Technologies; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Ultra Low Power UHF Wireless Subdural Electroencephalogram Electrode; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Modeling and Simulation of Access Point Coverage and Capacity; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Real Time Data Compression Applied to Advanced Electromagnetic Modeling and Telecommunications; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-Developing Dynamic Distributed Applications Using Adaptive Middleware Disaster Engineering</Abstract>

<Abstract>EAR-9515216 Lieberman, Bruce S. The proposed research addresses the fundamental problem of the role that ecological communities play in governing the evolution of life on earth. The Cambrian radiation is ideally suited as a paleontological system for studying this process because of the rapid pace of diversification, and because it marks the first appearance of marine communities and complex ecosystems containing diverse animals. To explore the relationship between paleoecological and evolutionary patterns and processes during the Cambrian, the Fellow will compare those patterns with those documented from later time periods while considering the environmental changes that accompanied the radiation. Specifically, did the evolutionary rules governing the rapid Cambrian radiation when complex communities were absent differ fundamentally from rules that operated later when communities were well established? The Fellow will draw upon his own expertise from the study of Devonian fossil lineages; he will apply paleoenvironmental analyses and multivariate statistical analyses of data on species distributions to identify paleocommunities and recurrent assemblages, and determine if they are stable or fluctuating with time. The study will increase understanding of the unique event in Earth history when animals began to diversify, and it will elucidate the role communities play in diversification and extinction.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Exurban residential development is widespread, constituting one of the major forms of land-use and land-cover changes in the Eastern US and elsewhere. This sprawl has large impacts on natural and rural landscapes, ecosystem services, and quality of life for millions of people. This project investigates the processes linking dynamics of land-atmosphere carbon budgets in exurban residential areas, preferences for land-cover types and patterns on these lands, and land-management activities of residents and developers. The goal of the project is to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships between carbon dynamics, land-management activities, and market and non-market values of land-uses and land-covers ? focusing on how carbon dynamics might respond in a non-linear fashion to various management and policy options for land-cover management. Building on the extensive data resources developed under a precursor project, the researchers will use dynamic agent-based models (including a new land-market sub model) to examine a range of exurban land-cover patterns that might be expected to result from market and policy drivers These models will be linked to homeowner preferences and landscape management behaviors from surveys. The outputs of the models will be coupled with a spatially explicit model of biogeochemistry, with inputs derived from remote sensing and field-based sampling within Southeastern Michigan. The researchers will explore the relationship between decision processes by various actors and the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes. We will look for the existence of ecologically significant thresholds (e.g., large, nonlinear land-atmosphere carbon exchange in response to small changes in policy, preferences or behaviors) that are revealed in the coupled system. The study will identify both modeled micro-level dynamics and macro-level patterns in space and time, building on data and model resources developed from previous projects, while creating a complementary new dataset to support modeling of land-market interactions that includes land transactions, biogeochemical processes, cultural preferences and management practices affecting land covers, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The complex feedbacks explored in this project, that both drive and result from exurban sprawl, will provide new insights into how policy can be used to guide and manage this landscape change. Coupled computer models will be used to evaluate policy scenarios that may be spatially-targeted (e.g., zoning) or aspatial (e.g., carbon credits) and are designed to affect carbon dynamics through mechanisms built on an understanding of the incentives created by markets and preferences and behaviors of residents, developers, and local governments. Field and modeling work on soil and vegetation carbon dynamics will provide much needed insights into the effects of exurban development on carbon storage, which, given the growth of exurban development, has important implications for the atmospheric carbon budget. The project strengthens scientific capacity and integration by bringing together scientists from a wide range of fields including landscape architecture, ecosystem science, economics, geographic information science, and complex systems science. The project will produce results that improve our ability to model (a) carbon cycling in the heterogeneous landscapes that humans inhabit, (b) the economic incentives inherent in our management exurban landscapes, and (c) the linkages between peoples? preferences and their behaviors and ecological landscape function. Models developed for the project will be used to generate both formal and informal educational materials for both graduate and undergraduate instruction on environmental science, policy, and design, in order to improve student understanding of how complex coupled human-environment dynamics can complicate decision making about ecosystem services, and how spatial and dynamic modeling can improve our understanding of alternative options in such settings.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify and determine the role of all the genes involved in a plants response to salt and water stress. Over the last decade, it has become clear that responses to water deficit and ion imbalance are governed by complex molecular and biochemical signal transduction processes, which coordinately act to determine tolerance or sensitivity at the whole-plant levet. Within the last five years, however, advances in genomics, informatics, and functional genomics have made it technically feasible to gain a global understanding of the gene complement or set that becomes integrated to effect abiotic stress tolerance. To tackle the genetic basis of this tolerance in higher plants in the most efficient, comprehensive, and integrative way possible Drs. R. Bressan, P. Hasegawa ( Purdue University), R. Burnap, J. Cushman, R. Prade (Oklahoma State University) and H. Bohnert, D. Gaibraith, J-K. Zhu (University of Arizona) have formed a consortium. Each participant has a documented and extensive experience in this research area with a proven record of productivity and in many instances past or present collaborations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This team will employ three distinct, yet complementary approaches to isolate, characterize, and assess the function of the core set of stress-related genes that provide the basis for the water and salt stress tolerance phenotype in plants.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The first approach will encompass the functional identification of genes important to stress tolerance by random and targeted mutagenesis strategies in well-studied model organisms (Synechocystis PCC6803, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans, and Arabidopsis thaliana). For Arabidopsis, they will identify, map and clone genetic Ioci from a large set of mutants defective in stress tolerance or signaling. The resulting sets of mutants will be used for complementation studies using genes from higher plant sources.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The second approach aims to define the core set of stress-related transcripts from both sensitive plants (Arabidopsis thaliana and rice) and resistant plants (Dunaliella salina and ice plant) using EST sequendng and microarray analysis. This approach will focus on the comparative study of gene expression patterns in salt and drought sensitive and resistant organisms, since recent studies of resistant organisms have revealed the existence of mechanisms of stress tolerance not present or not appropriately expressed in sensitive organisms.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The third approach will extend the functional analysis of stress-related transcripts by monitoring in situ Iocalizations by using promoter trapping approaches and gain-of-function studies.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These approaches represent logical extensions of ongoing work in individual groups within this center. They will foster interaction and integration of Consortium activities through daily interactions, workshops/meetings and extended work periods in member laboratories for their students and postdoctoral fellows to ensure a new generation of researchers trained in multi-faceted and interdisciplinary problem solving. The impact of abiotic stress on crop productivity is remarkable according to USDA statistics and amounts to two-thirds of all yield reductions in agriculture. This proposal is exceptionally timely, combines unique expertise, is hypothesis-driven and culminates in a dearly defined goal - understanding the number, nature and networking of genes and physiological mechanisms that constitute plant abiotic stress tolerance.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Biological systems are the product of an evolutionary process of random tinkering and selection that resulted in unexpected and non-intuitive ?engineering? solutions to dynamically varying conditions. Thus, biological systems are robust, adaptive and evolvable information processing systems that operate asynchronously and in parallel on multiple scales. The examination and characterization of the design principles of biological circuits has the potential to revolutionize biology, medicine and the way computing and communication systems are built. This project is pioneering important advances at the interface between biology and computation by pursuing two complementary goals: (1) to develop a modular, parallel-ready simulator to replicate the multi-scalar architecture of complex biological systems; (2) to discover key design principles relevant to information processing systems in general by reproducing biological design in silico. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Information processing by cells encompasses multiple scales connecting molecular events to phenotypes. Current simulation techniques have limited multi-scale and modular capabilities, resulting in models that describe only a single feature of a given system and miss the relationships between architecture, function and behavior. This research effort addresses these limitations by representing biological systems as a hierarchy of functional executable modules. The design of the platform obeys four basic principles: 1) components are objects; 2) objects are governed by rules; 3) rules include some degree of stochasticity; and 4) objects and rules are organized in functional and spatial modules that compose a hierarchy. The development of the new platform is driven by the construction of simulations of key biological model systems with an unprecedented scope and precision, such as bacterial chemotaxis, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, the acute inflammatory response, and parallel processing by bacterial colonies. The reproduction of these biological systems in silico is providing insights into their design principles, which in turn advances the future design and implementation of distributed technological systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>ABSTRACT&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Numerous applications involve the storage and retrieval of spatial and metric data from databases. Efficiency of the algorithms and underlying representations is the key to effectively using such databases. This research addresses efficiency issues from the perspective of applications in spatial and metric databases involving queries such as nearest neighbor finding. The goal is to speed up operations that arise in applications in computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), and computer vision that make use of large databases. The applications that are considered include the fast computation of point cloud models as well the efficient representation of data such as terrains via triangulations of the underlying surface. The implementation of such data in a distributed environment is also studied.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In this project we are investigating three related topics. First is computing k nearest neighbor joins for point cloud models in computer graphics applications. In particular, rather than computing the k nearest neighbors for each data point, we reuse the set of neighbors of the points for which we have already performed the task. The approach is to exploit the concept of locality of a given object q (e.g., a point, a block containing a query point, or an arbitrary object) in a search hierarchy defined to be the set of blocks which could contain the k nearest neighbors of q. We investigate this in the context of moving object databases where the query object is in motion while the remaining objects in the database are stationary (e.g., gas stations, buildings, restaurants, etc.). The goal is to determine the region that must be searched to find the k nearest neighbors of an object or objects whose motion is restricted to a particular region of space. We are devising efficient (possibly optimal) methods to compute the locality based on our incremental nearest neighbor algorithm. We explore computation of the Hausdorff distance that is used in computer vision and computer graphics. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Second is an investigation of distributed spatial indexes for applications in P2P networks. The approach is to apply our incremental nearest neighbor algorithm in such an environment. We also extend CHORD method to provide key-based lookup service in a distributed spatial index in conjunction with a larger variety of spatial indexes. Additionally, we study the relationship of the CAN key-based lookup service to a quadtree. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Third is in indexing triangulations. Triangulations are usually represented using a variant of an adjacency structure that stores the topological relations between the triangles. Finding the actual triangle that contains the query point requires the imposition of an index on the collection of triangles. We are devising a mathematical model that helps evaluate the efficiency of using a bucketing method based on the PM2 quadtree to store the triangulation. The model uses geometric probability.</Abstract>

The project will develop an initial digital library of artifacts gathered in the domain of Nautical Archaeology and use it to examine and build tools and applications for research and scholarly practice in the area. The project will design, implement, and evaluate a framework that will: 1) efficiently catalog, store, and manage artifacts and ship remains along its associated data and information produced by an underwater archeological excavation, 2) integrate heterogeneous data sources from different media to facilitate research work and handle uncertainty in data and structure, 3) incorporate historic sources to help in the study of current artifacts, 4) develop visualization tools to help researchers manipulate, observe, study, and analyze artifacts and their relationships; and 5) develop algorithm and visualization based mechanisms for ship reconstruction, i.e., to determine where recovered pieces and fragments fit in a whole.. The project will draw its materials from an extensive collection of artifacts gathered from a shipwreck in Portugal as well as the extensive archives collected at the NAP during field studies over the past 32 years. Gathering artifacts from the field provides the basic data that drives many areas of scientific inquiry. While a major focus of today&amp;apos;s digital libraries research is concerned with collecting, organizing and managing archives of diverse topical data, research focused in specific topic areas can produce digital libraries that functionally go beyond mere information warehousing to support very specific tasks necessary for scholarship in a given topical area. The intellectual merit of this proposal is relevant to both Computer Science and Nautical Archaeology research agendas. The project&amp;apos;s research has the potential for application within many areas of scientific study, particularly within those that incorporate aspects of fieldwork.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The construction of knowledge-based systems is extremely labor-intensive. Unfortunately, current tools for building knowledge-based systems do not allow developers to take significant advantage of previous knowledge bases when building new systems. The research supported by this award involves design of a novel architecture for the construction of knowledge-based systems. The architecture allows system builders either to select an existing problem-solving method from a library, or to construct a new problem-solving method from a set of predefined building blocks. The developer then maps the data requirements of the problem-solving method to elements of reusable domain ontologies that define models of particular application areas. Both the domain ontologies and the problem-solving methods that are used to build knowledge-based systems are stored in libraries that future developers can access when implementing new applications. The research thus addresses strategies to index and retrieve problem-solving methods and domain ontologies, and to integrate these components within new problem-solving frameworks. The research will allow construction of new classes of tools for building knowledge-based systems, and will define an infrastructure that supports the reuse of knowledge-base components at increasingly high levels of abstraction. //</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this research is to provide seamless access to the networked computational and information resources from mobile, wirelessly connected systems. Such systems will be an integral component of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Some of the current obstacles in building such a ubiquitous access system on mobile platforms include their limited compute power, disks, battery life etc., as well as the limited and variable bandwidth of the wireless networks. Moreover, the next generation of radio communication hardware will engender ad-hoc networks which current proxy based mobile access models cannot handle. The approach in this research is to create agent oriented middleware which overcomes the limitations of the mobile hosts as well as wireless networks, and helps integrate them into the high performance computer and communication systems that form the backbone of the NII. The middleware transcodes (multimedia) data streams to enable weakly connected access, and integrates software component based systems to provide computational power to mobile hosts. This allows the systems to create information from available data to respond to queries, which is useful when the queries are in non-trivial domains (e.g. scientific information, electronic commerce). Moreover, the system provides disconnection management, and integrates techniques for cooperative information filtering. The system supports both proxy based and end-end data management approaches and their relative efficacy is compared. It is expected that this work will lead to the development of software systems needed to support mobile information access in complex, real world applications, and allow the NII to handle the diversity of scale presented by mobile clients connected over low bandwidth wireless (ad-hoc) networks to the high bandwidth network backbone and powerful servers. The educational component of this proposal has two aspects. One focuses on creating courses in the area of the proposed research work and training undergraduate and graduate students. The other leverages the proposed research to create adaptive electronic notebooks for science and engineering education which use (existing) courseware, digital libraries and other data repositories. It is expected that the electronic notebook software will be used by non-traditional students in continuing education programs who use low bandwidth dial-in or wireless connections. http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~ajoshi/career/</Abstract>

<Abstract>This grant provides funding for the establishment of an engineering virtual organization (EVO) to further the science of discrete-event logistics systems (DELSs), using cyberinfrastructure (CI) as an enabling technology. The community of DELS researchers has been and largely continues to be?organized around the paradigm of sub-optimizing subsets of activities or subsets of issues. We seek to establish the DELS EVO and supporting CI that will create an alternative system-oriented paradigm for DELS research by making it possible for teams of researchers to address broader system issues from a unified and comprehensive perspective. The foundational technologies for the EVO will be high-fidelity digital mockups of large-scale complex DELS, combined with high-bandwidth distributed computing. The essential enabling technology is a new systems modeling language?SysML?that provides the descriptive power needed for comprehensive, unified representations of DELS.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The active engagement of the DELS community?both academics and practitioners will be facilitated by this effort through a series of meetings at professional conferences and company locations that culminate at a meeting to describe a DELS CI prototype, defining the user requirements for the EVO, the critical operational principles, and the highest-priority research initiatives. This prototype will be realized by launching an initial EVO web presence, and by demonstrating, in a limited way, the potential for creating high-fidelity representations of DELS, and using distributed computing to support DELS design. If successful, the results from this effort will enable individuals and groups to engage high-fidelity digital mockups of DELS through standard web-based technologies. This capability will fundamentally change the way the DELS domain is taught and learned, by making learning about DELS richer and much more immediate to students. In addition, the creation of even a crude DELS theory will have very important significance for developers of large scale software systems used to plan, operate, and control DELS.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Language data is central to the research of a large social sciences community - not only linguists, but also anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, and sociologists interested in the culture of indigenous peoples. Members of this research community are currently faced with two urgent situations: the number of languages in the world is rapidly diminishing while the number of initiatives to create digital archives of language data is rapidly multiplying. The latter might seem to be an unalloyed good in the face of the former, but there are two ways things may go wrong without adequate collaboration among archivists, linguists, and language engineers. First, a common standard for the digitization of linguistic data may never be agreed upon. And the resulting variation in archiving practices and language representation would seriously inhibit data access, searching, and cross-linguistic comparison. Second, standards may be implemented without guidance from the people who best know the range of structural possibilities in human language-descriptive linguists who have done fieldwork on poorly described languages.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If digital archives of language data and documentation are to offer the widest possible access and to provide information in a maximally useful form, consensus must be reached about certain aspects of archive infrastructure. As the largest linguistic organization in the world and the central electronic publication of the discipline, The LINGUIST List &amp;lt;http://www.linguistlist.org&amp;gt; is organizing a collaborative project with a dual objective: (1) to preserve endangered languages data and documentation and (2) to aid in the development of infrastructure for linguistic archives. One outcome of the project will be a LINGUIST List digital archive housing data from 10 endangered languages. But the focus on infrastructure will produce other, equally important results. In the first place, The LINGUIST archive will function, not only as a repository, but also as a &amp;apos;showroom of best practice.&amp;apos; The archive will offer endangered languages data marked up and catalogued according to community consensus about best practice; furthermore, the archive will disseminate reference material delineating best practice and software tools supporting it. Another outcome will be the establishment on the LINGUIST List site of a central metadata server for the discipline; this server will organize information on all the language-related resources residing at distributed sites, not just endangered languages information alone. Other infrastructure-related outcomes include (1) the involvement of the linguistics community in establishing best practice, (2) the widespread dissemination of the resulting recommendations, and (3) the hands-on training of a substantial core of linguists and language archivists in the implementation of the guidelines. Although the data collection efforts will focus initially on endangered languages, the metadata server, the recommendations for best practice, and the distribution of supporting software will have a significant impact on all empirical research in linguistics. The project will thus add value to many other language-related projects currently planned or underway.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that will allow robots to discover theoretical entities -- that is, causally relevant features of the environment that cannot be sensed directly. The algorithms developed by the PI will make it possible for robots to expand their understanding and control of the world around them by discovering theoretical entities, such as force and mass, in much the same way as human scientists do. This project also aims to shed light on human cognition, particularly about how we acquire foundational concepts. Bayesian Model Merging will be used to learn a model of the robot&amp;apos;s environment. Non-determinism in action outcomes indicates the existence of theoretical entities, and mutual information among posited theoretical entities suggests that a single entity explains observed non-determinism and validates its causal efficacy. This work will be evaluated in three domains: (1) a simulated robot with realistic physics, (2) process control in an aluminum smelting plant, and (3) visual object recognition. This project will make it possible for robots to see beyond the &amp;quot;veil of perception&amp;quot;, to overcome limitations of their sensory systems (as humans have), and to better understand, predict, and control their environments. In applying these algorithms to the aluminum smelting process, it will lead to reductions in energy consumption and production of greenhouse gases. Planned educational activities include working with female and minority undergraduate students, teaching a freshman seminar on the scientific method, and development of a new graduate-level course in robotics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The objective of this grant is to address research issues related to semantic interoperability, data mining and security and authorization in the multi-agency domain of border control. Partners are the Immigration and Naturalization Agency, the Customs Service, and the Coast Guard. In addition to the research issues that will be addressed in this proposed work, the development of a proof of concept in the form of a prototype will be undertaken. Specifically, in the area of semantic interoperability, the team focuses on providing expressive common language among information sources, automatic mapping, and the ability to dynamically adapt to changing environments. Furthermore, automatic text analysis and text mining techniques will be developed to automatically, rather than manually, build the knowledge base. The team addresses some of the challenges encountered when sharing information in a secure manner, including reconciling the heterogeneity among multiple security policies, resolving semantic heterogeneity among security policies, translation of coalition level policies to implementation level and vice versa, and support of delegation in coalition based systems. Also addressed will be issues related to data mining to build an alert system. This includes developing classification/segmentation models and merging of different local models to a global model for outlier analysis, real time data mining, and providing iterative and interactive visualization. The multidisciplinary research team, which comes from multi-institutions is augmented by a set of domain experts in several related areas, including homeland security, border control, global logistics, transportation security, foreign terrorist tracking, as well as domestic and multinational investigations. These domain experts provide guidance on the functional requirements of the system and feedback on the prototype system as it progresses through its development.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Moral notions and practices shape and are shaped by new technologies. Ethics for developing technologies involves identification and analysis of the ethical issues associated with a new technology in ways that can influence its design and use. Bringing ethical perspectives into the early stages of technological development is the best opportunity for those perspectives to have an influence.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project examines the discourse around artificial agent technology--computer systems that are described as autonomous decision-making entities--in order to understand how moral concepts and practices shape and are shaped by new technologies. Concepts of agency and autonomy are central to morality; they underpin the very possibility of morality and are strongly linked to concepts of responsibility and accountability. This project will examine how computer scientists and engineers conceptualize issues of responsibility with regard to artificial agents.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will focus on two case studies: 1) the discussion centered around artificial moral agents, and 2) the discourse about autonomous military robots. The overarching descriptive research question for each case is: How are notions of responsibility, agency, and autonomy being negotiated? The overarching normative question is: How should artificial agents be conceptualized and designed? The methodology combines discourse analysis, philosophical analysis, and in-depth interviews with computer scientists and engineers. The project will have broader impact by training a postdoctoral fellow in ethics in science research and qualitative social science research methods. The results will be disseminated broadly to scholars as well as those who are engaged in the development of artificial agent technology.</Abstract>

We make that contribution by implementing a prototype Internet platform through which a variety of GIS-based analytic-deliberative agendas and participatory choice models can be designed and implemented. As a broad impact with benefits to society, the Internet GIS platform will provide a technology prototype that supports enhanced participation in three, pervasive, transportation planning decision contexts common to metropolitan areas across the US. The results of the study are likely to be general enough to transfer to other planning contexts such as land use and environment, because the participation framework underlying the needs analysis is based in large part on public empowerment in decisions. Enhancing participation in decision making is a step toward improving local governance - a widespread challenge across western democracies.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project combines new design representations and computational approaches to enable computational conceptual design. The design representations and computational methods leverage the constant increases in computational power and information retrieval reasoning algorithms. Descriptive methods, stored knowledge, and algorithmic reasoning provide the potential for a computational theory of conceptual design that could greatly benefit the designer during difficult stages of concept generation. The underlying theme is the combination and formalization of function-based synthesis, constraint management and state space search. The primary objective of the work is to create a computational theory of conceptual design that can compute design alternatives. The computation will result in a comprehensive space of concept variants and search it for feasible candidates.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The activity of concept generation is one of the cornerstones of engineering design. Until recently, the only resources available to a designer during conceptual design were personal experiences and innate abilities. While the designer&amp;apos;s resources have advanced significantly in the last three decades, there is still a lack of continuity between computational design tools and conceptual design methods. Many formal methods of conceptual design have yet to be realized as computational algorithms. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research will develop representations and computational methods that allow design concepts to be created from the functional description of a needed product. Through the development of a design knowledge repository and a concept generator that uses the stored knowledge, this research extends the current understanding of the relationship between function and form and codifies it. Also, novel component representations enable computers to determine component compatibility and thus synthesize a concept variant. Additionally, this work is useful for comparison to human design behaviors, as it is built on commonly used design practices.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This work is both basic and practical in nature. Thus, the broader impacts extend beyond publication to the usage of the resultant knowledge, methods and tools in education, engineering practice and research. For example, students will be able to use the concept generator to create solutions that, because of their limited experience, they might otherwise not have developed. These solutions will expose students to different disciplines and engineering and scientific domains. The results of this research impact industry and research in a similar manner. In both cases, the research can be used to generate a broader array of solutions much more quickly than would have been possible without it.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Internet revolution has led organizations worldwide to rely heavily on information sharing over the Internet to conduct their daily business. Information sharing on the Internet usually occurs in broad, highly dynamic network-based environments, and formally accessing the resources in a secure manner poses a difficult challenge. Our focus is on the problems of secure information exchange and secure information access in Internet-based collaborative environments. The research objectives are as follows. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Secure group communication. In collaborative work and research environments, group members must be able to set up a reliable, secure information sharing and communication medium among them. Techniques will be developed for setting up secure group communication and providing a set of accesses to group members for a variety of digital data in highly dynamic networks.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Security services. Digital information in database systems generally represents sensitive and confidential information that organizations must protect and allow only authorized personnel to access and manipulate them. The research will address the issue of how to advocate selective information sharing in role-based systems while minimizing the risks of unauthorized access proposing a delegation framework. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework through policy specification, enforcement, and a proof-of-concept implementation.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal presents a new approach to improve data preservation and accessibility ? the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) Project ? a comprehensive plan for fleet-wide data management. R2R will be a central shore-side data gateway through which underway data from each expedition are routinely cataloged and transmitted from UNOLS ship operators to long-term national archives. R2R will provide essential data documentation services including the production of standardized cruise-level metadata, data inventories, navigation products, and an operations report for every expedition. Tools for routine logging of over-the-side sensor deployments and sampling stations will be developed and deployed to facilitate creation of a sampling ?event log? for each cruise. In partnership with the Shipboard Automated Meteorological and Oceanographic System (SAMOS; http://samos.coaps.fsu.edu/) Data Assembly Center (DAC), R2R protocols will be established for near real-time transfer and automated Quality Assessment (QA) of meteorological and thermosalinograph data providing direct feedback to operators while the cruise is underway. R2R will coordinate the development of routines for post-cruise QA of underway data types, with initial development focused on geophysical sensors (multibeam sonar, subbottom profilers, magnetics, gravity), and subsequent expansion to other sensors (CTD, ADCP, etc). Using R2R tools, underway data will be categorized and sufficiently documented for submission to long-term National Data Centers (NDCs) operated by NOAA, and to DACs specialized in the reduction and analysis of specific data types. Our approach will be to leverage and augment the existing centralized information resources of the UNOLS office, ship operators, and NDCs to facilitate the documentation and delivery of oceanographic data from ?rolling deck? to ?repository.? Our vision is that working directly with ship operators and technicians will ensure more complete and consistent acquisition, quality, preservation, and dissemination of these high-value data, thereby transforming the academic fleet into an integrated global observing system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: Access to research vessels is becoming increasingly more expensive and difficult. The R2R project will help to leverage these costs for the benefit of the entire ocean science community and any other potential users of the data that will be routinely collected, checked and properly archived. As the proposers state, this will essentially make the UNOLS fleet an observatory system that will have coastal, regional and global scope, providing data sets useful to current and future researchers. Going forward with this project, even though it may seem expensive will in the long run make our investment in the research vessels, instrumentation and operational costs much more cost effective.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The objective of this research award is to develop an informatics based approach to the accelerated design and discovery of new radiation detector materials. The research will integrate the formal methods of statistical learning in information theory to first-principles and mesoscale modeling, measurements of radiation detection characteristics, and novel high throughput screening and modeling studies of defects in inorganic scintillator materials. The experimental component of the program will introduce a novel atomic scale combinatorial screening technique for dopant diffusion and charge transport analysis to identify the interaction between crystal chemistry and defects, and their role in affecting signal efficiency and energy resolution. The experimental data will be used to refine our statistical learning predictions, as well as provide critical insight into mechanisms that will guide the interpretation of the statistical learning analysis.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;It is expected that this project will lead to new materials with optimized properties that can significantly improve radiation detector performance beyond those presently available. This research will also contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between materials chemistry, crystallography, defects and diffusion, and radiation detection characteristics. This interdisciplinary, collaborative work will be facilitated by a cyberinfrastructure for data sharing between Iowa State University (ISU), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL. This cooperative effort will be used to develop a ?Materials Design Traineeship Program? for graduate students and post doctoral fellows in cooperation with LANL to train the next generation of national facilities scientists with both materials informatics and facility-specific expertise. Educational activities include the development of novel teaching materials for high schools and undergraduate courses that demonstrate the connections between statistical learning and materials science. Teaching activities to engage and promote students and faculty from underrepresented groups will also be developed as part of this program.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award supports a project to establish a new computational paradigm and infrastructure that will enhance three-dimensional (3-D) atomic reconstruction for an emerging new instrumentation technology; atom probe tomography (APT). The project will significantly advance research in parallel computing, computational geometry and graph-theoretic applications of extremely large and noisy data sets. APT is a powerful microscopy tool that enables spatial resolution of hundreds of millions of atoms at the sub-nanoscale. The APT is the only instrument capable of mapping the 3-D composition of a metal, semiconductor, or an insulator with atomic resolution. The 3-D reconstruction of this direct space information provides unprecedented capabilities for characterizing materials at the atomic level. The quantitative analysis of APT images could provide the ability to directly observe and interpret atomistic scale solid state phenomena that until now, have only been visualized via modeling and computer simulation. The unique APT images, transformed as cloud data points, provide an ideal template for developing graphtheoretic and differential geometric techniques that allow (1) assimilation of dynamic, noisy and/or incomplete data during reconstruction, (2) development of parallel algorithms for 3D reconstruction, and (3) extraction of multi-scale geometric features and statistics from the 3D data. This research will yield new computational tools and algorithms that can effectively utilize computing platforms for noise insensitive reconstruction, which can significantly improve our abilities to quantitatively analyze APT data. These advancements will be possible due to developments in uncertainty quantification, model reduction of complex systems, and scalable algorithms. Data-driven model reduction strategies that dynamically account for the noisy data during the 3D reconstruction and efficiently extract atomic coordination and radial distribution functions will be developed to directly link atomic-scale structure and chemical data with materials properties and behavior.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A virtual organization (VO) will be established, targeting the rapidly growing global community of APT users and the computational sciences community that is involved in modeling and applications of very large data sets. The VO will be initially hosted at Iowa State University (ISU) and later linked to the NSF TeraGrid to ensure a sustainable and accessible cyberinfrastructure. Educational and outreach activities will include (1) interdepartmental graduate courses on computational nanosciences, (2) summer research programs on data mining and parallel computing for undergraduate students , (3) development of novel teaching materials for high school and first-year courses that demonstrate the connections between data mining and materials science --- this will be class tested through ISU&amp;apos;s Science Bound program, which actively engages students from underrepresented groups; (4) workshops on quantitative APT that will be linked to ISU&amp;apos;s NSF-ADVANCE program to promote participation by women faculty and other under-represented groups; and (5) leverage international collaborations based on our NSF International Materials Institute.</Abstract>

The problem arises from the distributed nature of government agencies, the lack of top down leadership, and the remnants of &amp;quot;silo&amp;quot; architectures seen in legacy mainframe agency information systems. The explosive growth of the web has exposed this inability to integrate data and the consequent inability to ask sensible questions which cross agency lines; e.g., &amp;quot;what benefits can I expect from various government agencies when I retire.&amp;quot; Moving this distributed data to one place is not an option. Rather, technology must be developed to access the data where it is held, using common data definitions, or ontologies and an interface.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This grant will support work on this problem in the areas of query infrastructure, middleware for the web, and dynamic inter-ontology support. The government collaborators are the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, the Indiana Dept. of Workforce Development, and the US Dept. of Health and Human Services.</Abstract>

<Abstract>IRI-9504138 Kuipers, Benjamin University of Texas-Austin $93,501-12 mos An Ontological Hierarchy for Spatial Knowledge Spatial knowledge is an important and ubiquitous kind of commonsense knowledge. it also raises a critical issue facing computational models of mind: the relationship between behavior in the continuous world and inference with discrete symbolic representations. in this project, a hierarchy of representations for spatial knowledge called the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) developed in a previous NSF grant is being formalized so that it can be more widely useful. The formalization will clarify precisely when and how different descriptive ontologies and inference methods can interact effectively. It will also identify the minimal preconditions on sensors, effectors, and environment required for the spatial model to apply and identify the minimal set of targets for machine learning and discovery required to learn an instance of the hierarchical spatial model from experience. It will be evaluated both mathematically and experimentally on simulated and physical robots. The results should be theoretically important to the foundations of artificial intelligence and practically important to intelligent robotics applications.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The LTER Network Office (NET) was transferred to the University of New Mexico in 1997. NET objectives have been to provide basic services to LTER, facilitate communication among LTER sites and between LTER and the broader environmental sciences community, promote new technologies, and provide leadership in data and information management. Since NET moved to Albuquerque, LTER has grown from 18 to 24 sites and the number of associated scientists has expanded from 894 to more than 1500. This proposal represents a request to renew the LTER Network Office for the next six years. Five essential NET Service functions that are central to the operation of LTER would be continued and enhanced to better meet community needs. Funding is also requested to expand four other focal areas that are key to broadening the impact of LTER on science and society.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The five essential NET functions supported through this project include: (1) service to the LTER community (e.g., proposal preparation, accounting, meeting coordination); (2) computational and communication infrastructure (e.g., e-mail, database backups, web access); (3) information management and methods development (e.g., data and metadata standardization, curation and expansion of LTER Network databases); (4) network development, community outreach and training (e.g., coordination of the Partnership for Biodiversity Informatics, OBFS training and database development); and (5) publications and public outreach (e.g., newsletters, web site, synthesis volumes). Two expanded and related NET functions are essential to enabling LTER to reach new levels of understanding of long-term ecological patterns and processes: (6) Synthesis (e.g., integration and synthesis via working groups, creation of value-added databases) and (7) Information System Design and Development (e.g., distributed data networking, data&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;integration tools). Funding is also requested to continue and broaden the impacts that LTER has on the international scientific community and environmental education in the United States via: (8) International LTER (e.g., coordination of ILTER meetings, ILTER publications, informatics training) and (9) Education (e.g., facilitation of site-based education programs, workshops). A tenth activity, the implementation of a 21 st Century Strategic Plan for the LTER Network, would be completed within the first two years of the NET renewal.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;During the next six years, the LTER Network office will continue to facilitate knowledge advances and understanding within ecology by (1) promoting LTER communication among sites and throughout the ecological sciences and (2) disseminating data, information, and knowledge via the web, synthesis and publications, training, and community and public outreach. New efforts and resources devoted to synthesis and information system development, international LTER, and education will significantly broaden the impact of LTER science by enabling us to better provide integrated and synthetic data and information to the broader scientific community, students, and policy-makers. In addition, we will greatly increase our efforts to expand LTER into a global scientific enterprise via ILTER and expand the reach of LTER education beyond&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the schoolyard (i.e., from K-12 to policy-makers to the general public). We will further expand our efforts to reach underserved groups, incorporating an enhanced focus on Chicanos and Native Americans.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The revised SOW comprises the ten following sections, arranged to reflect the organization of DEB-0236154. A revised budget and budget justification accompany this document. Strategic planning documents will be submitted separately. Each section of the SOW details activities which will and will not take place under the revised budget. The requested budget is tied to specific activities, which in turn are linked to the personnel time needed to complete the activity. The revised SOW specifically identifies&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;activities that will benefit the LTER Network, the International LTER Network, the general scientific community, the education community, the University of New Mexico (UNM), or NSF.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research aims at developing an integrated set of ontological conventions that addresses the needs of experimental sciences. In the researchersO earlier work in developing knowledge models for experimental biology, it was discovered that there were several important areas where the knowledge to be represented poses fundamental challenges to standard ontological frameworks. For example: 1) the traditional part-of hierarchy is ill-suited to model the complex substances and mixtures described in scientific experiments; 2) the primacy of categorization in knowledge representation, which fundamentally defines entities in terms of category membership, is at odds with the need to represent events (such as biochemical reactions) that convert one substance into another. The proposed research will improve the likelihood that ongoing artificial intelligence in knowledge sharing technology will be of benefit to researchers in experimental sciences.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A conference on &amp;quot;Ontological, Epistemological, Linguistic and Pedagogical Considerations of Language and Science Literacy: Empowering Research and Informing Instruction&amp;quot; is proposed. The emphases of the conference are (1) the development of theoretical framework for understanding and developing language-science literacy connections and (2) establishing a group of researchers interested in classroom-based research projects focused on critical, practice-derived issues language and science literacy issues. A premise is that research needs to focus on determining what science literacy practices work in the classroom and build explanations of why these work. The conference will address (1) clarification of the roles of speaking, reading, writing, and listening in authentic science learning communities in elementary, middle, secondary, post-secondary, and post-graduate settings, (2) exploration of the influences of information technologies on language and science literacy, (3) the establishment of a contemporary theoretical framework involving language, information technology, science and science literacy, and (4) the consolidation and extension of international, interdisciplinary and intergenerational network of professional scientists, applied cognitive scientists, language and science researchers, graduate students, and teacher educators.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The conference will begin by exploring the nature of science, the linguistic components of doing science, the ontological and epistemological considerations in science literacy, the influence of information technology on language production and processing, and the critical relationships between language, science, and science learning. It will continue by summarizing the results of recent explorations of oral and written discourse on science literacy. The conference will conclude by outlining some avenues for future research, some implications for classroom practice, and some applications for teacher education.</Abstract>

<Abstract>How can scientists create and share scientific knowledge in a way that simultaneously takes advantage of new technologies and information systems and recognizes the increasingly diverse, global nature of knowledge production? The problem of how to work with differing ways of knowing, with differing ontologies, is a central question to business, the natural and social sciences, and designers and users of information technology. This issue is particularly relevant for any institution that holds the task of assembling, collecting, representing, and displaying information and objects that may have different meanings for communities and professions. For these &amp;quot;information institutions&amp;quot; maintaining the coherence of a data set while still being ontologically diverse has become a key tension. Rather than trying to mitigate this tension, this project explores how digital media systems can put this tension to productive and creative use. The principle investigators evaluate the hypothesis that information systems can be created to support distributed knowledges and multiple ontologies, and that these systems can serve the multiple communities as well as contribute to the creation and sharing of emergent scientific knowledge. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research involves the design, creation, and evaluation of a set of networked sites that share digital objects among three expert communities: a group of archaeologists, the Zuni indigenous community of New Mexico, and a set of curators from the five partner organizations. Through the research team&amp;apos;s analyses of the objects, how they are described in different ways, and interviews/focus groups with each of the three communities, they will uncover means by which systems can work with multiple knowledge-based traditions rather than sweep away these differences by classifying them into singular standards. This research will have broad impact by creating and evaluating new models for broadening participation in science. The project focuses on how to produce and share knowledge in behavioral sciences such as anthropology and archaeology, but it provides a model of stakeholder participation for other disciplines as well.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award provides funding for a 3 1/2 day workshop, the goal of which is to uncover new information and/or understandings that can be gained by bringing together Indigenous and sustainability science and ultimately used to inform sustainable practices. The proposed workshop will challenge key thinkers in these areas to cultivate mutually conducive and appropriate principles, protocols, and practices that address the global need to sustain resilient landscapes. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This workshop is a direct response to a previous weeklong workshop held in 2010, &amp;quot;Indigenous Ecological Knowledges and Geographic Information Systems: Exploring ontologically Compatible Techniques and Technologies.&amp;quot; The workshop was an international interdisciplinary group of Indigenous scholars, cultural practitioners, students and non-Indigenous scholars working with or for Indigenous communities to discuss the development of spatial data infrastructure (SDI) capable of representing Indigenous perspectives of modeling environmental phenomena. The organizer of the workshop, the late Dr. Deanna Kingston of Oregon State University, concluded at the completion of the workshop, &amp;quot;We learned two things: 1. Each Indigenous community as well as each academic discipline is at a different developmental stage of understanding, the who, what, when, where, and why of SDI representation, which means we needed to collectively identify the starting point and path for this kind of project. 2. One of the points of collective agreement was the necessity of relating to our environments through sustainable principles, protocols, and practices (Hi&amp;apos;iaka Working Group, 2011).&amp;quot; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The WIS2DOM workshop will build on the lessons learned from the first workshop, by facilitating the concluding perspective that indigenous peoples who maintain a strong connection with their territory through subsistence or sustainable agriculture have a deep spatial knowledge that fully integrates humans into the natural world, a knowledge that is not fundamentally different from the developing transdisciplinary science of sustainability. The PIs maintain that despite holding a similar vision of sustaining resilient landscapes, Indigenous and sustainability sciences have not entered into dialogue on how to accomplish this common goal. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research team and organizers of this workshop recognize the value of ontological pluralism with regard to advancing scientific research and through this proposed workshop, will bring Indigenous and sustainability scientists into dialogue in order to diversify methods toward meeting common goals. The PIs recognize that dialogue across ontological boundaries poses significant challenges, but believe that the relationship between Indigenous and sustainability science is not dichotomous but is instead significantly complimentary. This project proposes to create a welcoming space for the exchange of ideas and concepts between what have previously been conceptualized as very divergent knowledge systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The project is supported by the Science, Technology, and Society program. The PI has been awarded a professional development fellowship to enable him to develop expertise in the philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics (the physical theory of molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic systems). He will work closely with Dr. Malcolm Forster, professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The PI has published a series of papers on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics in which he has put forth a new geometrical approach to quantum mechanics so as to address fundamental conceptual puzzles that have been debated since the inception of the theory in the 1920s.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The new approach begins by treating space as a part of a larger quantum mechanically defined space of states in a mathematically rigorous way. One of the core ideas of the approach is that a physical system is in the classical space (meaning the space of everyday experience) if and only if and only if quantum mechanics predicts with certainty that it has a precise position, which is usually expressed by saying that the state of the system is characterized by a Dirac delta function associated with the physical quantity position. In all other states, the particle is not in physical space. This approach provides a new interpretation of the ontological meaning of superpositions (additive combinations) of classical states; namely, that particles in superpositions are not in space. This involves the rejection of a dogma that gripped our way of thinking about reality throughout the ages: Everything that exists is located in space. Rejection of this dogma has far-reaching implications for many widely discussed issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, such as particle-wave duality, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument and the meaning of non-locality, the nature of quantum measurement and the collapse of the wave packet.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;With the fellowship support, the PI will develop, document, and debate the implications indicated above from a philosophical standpoint in careful, accessible, and clear manner that is well informed by the vast philosophical literature on the subject. The project promises to improve our understanding of what, if anything, quantum mechanics is telling us about the world behind the observable phenomena. It address the most fundamental and challenging problems in the philosophy of physics. The results of this research will be of interest to philosophers and theoretical physicists alike, and to any members of the general public who are interested in what contemporary physics may be telling us about the world. The even broader impact of this could be in the teaching of quantum mechanics to beginning students; especially those who want to understand the theories in terms of a &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; rather than merely to learn how to use them to make calculations.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many disciplines of modern biology have undergone a revolution in data acquisition. With the advent of high throughput technologies, data is accumulating at a pace that outstrips our ability to convert that data into knowledge. Application of these technologies can provide terabyte amounts of data relevant to a particular biological problem but interpreting that volume of information remains a challenge. A variety of resources are available to help researchers visualize, categorize and ultimately make sense out of their data. Visualization tools such as those in KEGG or Reactome, place data in the context of signaling and metabolic pathways. Many different ontologies, text mining and enrichment analysis tools have been developed to help categorize individual data points into groups. Both visualization and categorization reduce the complexity of the problem and provide insight into the underlying biology. Ultimately, however, people are still in need for the essential steps of integrating, evaluating and, finally, converting these data to human knowledge. What is needed a novel, dynamic approach to pathway visualization along with integrating disparate ontologies and information found in text to improve the researcher&amp;apos;s ability to convert high throughput data into understanding. This will be achieved by developing PathBubbles -- a dynamic, interactive pathway visualization tool using the existing Vis- and Code Bubbles as a framework. In addition additional information will be provided by integrating data found in specific ontologies, text-mining tools and expression data to provide gene annotation for use with PathBubbles. Finally, capturing functional information about post-translationally modified proteins from literature and integrating this information into PathBubbles, will assist users in developing testable hypotheses. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Humans are visual animals, relying on visual input to sense and orient themselves to the environment. One consequence of this is that humans are very able to recognize patterns in visually displayed information. This work exploits this ability to help biologists analyze thousands of pathway data points by developing a novel web based interface where information is displayed as a graph. This graph will display data from gene studies where each gene product is shown as a dot and the connections between the genes are lines. The dots that represent gene products can be colored depending on the activity of the gene in a particular biological condition. For example, if the gene is expressed at a very high level in a cancer cell compared to a normal cell, the dot will be displayed in red. In addition, the lines may represent a variety of interactions such as binding between gene products or sharing of a small molecule and the type of interaction can be indicated by different line colors. The graphical interface is supported by an extensive database of information about each gene product and each interaction. Users will be able to access that information by simply clicking on the dot or line of interest. A particularly novel aspect of this project is that users will be able to add their own data by using an interface that allows them to create new dots (gene products) and lines (interactions). They will then be able to provide functional information about what happens, for instance, when their gene product interacts with a pre-existing gene product already in the database. Based on this new information, the system will then predict the effect of the user&amp;apos;s new gene product on the biological pathways. This will allow users to ask &amp;apos;what if&amp;apos; questions, using this interface to test hypotheses before doing actual experiments. While the system is being developed in the context of biology, the ability to graphically test different hypotheses will have application to a variety of other disciplines including chemistry, engineering, physics and computer sciences.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Many disciplines of modern biology have undergone a revolution in data acquisition. With the advent of high throughput technologies, data is accumulating at a pace that outstrips our ability to convert that data into knowledge. Application of these technologies can provide terabyte amounts of data relevant to a particular biological problem but interpreting that volume of information remains a challenge. A variety of resources are available to help researchers visualize, categorize and ultimately make sense out of their data. Visualization tools such as those in KEGG or Reactome, place data in the context of signaling and metabolic pathways. Many different ontologies, text mining and enrichment analysis tools have been developed to help categorize individual data points into groups. Both visualization and categorization reduce the complexity of the problem and provide insight into the underlying biology. Ultimately, however, people are still in need for the essential steps of integrating, evaluating and, finally, converting these data to human knowledge. What is needed a novel, dynamic approach to pathway visualization along with integrating disparate ontologies and information found in text to improve the researcher?s ability to convert high throughput data into understanding. This will be achieved by developing PathBubbles, a dynamic, interactive pathway visualization tool using the existing Vis- and Code Bubbles as a framework. In addition additional information will be provided by integrating data found in specific ontologies, text-mining tools and expression data to provide gene annotation for use with PathBubbles. Finally, capturing functional information about post-translationally modified proteins from literature and integrating this information into PathBubbles, will assist users in developing testable hypotheses. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Humans are visual animals, relying on visual input to sense and orient themselves to the environment. One consequence of this is that humans are very able to recognize patterns in visually displayed information. This work exploits this ability to help biologists analyze thousands of pathway data points by developing a novel web based interface where information is displayed as a graph. This graph will display data from gene studies where each gene product is shown as a dot and the connections between the genes are lines. The dots that represent gene products can be colored depending on the activity of the gene in a particular biological condition. For example, if the gene is expressed at a very high level in a cancer cell compared to a normal cell, the dot will be displayed in red. In addition, the lines may represent a variety of interactions such as binding between gene products or sharing of a small molecule and the type of interaction can be indicated by different line colors. The graphical interface is supported by an extensive database of information about each gene product and each interaction. Users will be able to access that information by simply clicking on the dot or line of interest. A particularly novel aspect of this project is that users will be able to add their own data by using an interface that allows them to create new dots (gene products) and lines (interactions).

<Abstract>This award provides funding for a 3 1/2 day workshop, the goal of which is to uncover new information and/or understandings that can be gained by bringing together Indigenous and sustainability science and ultimately used to inform sustainable practices. The proposed workshop will challenge key thinkers in these areas to cultivate mutually conducive and appropriate principles, protocols, and practices that address the global need to sustain resilient landscapes. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This workshop is a direct response to a previous weeklong workshop held in 2010, &amp;quot;Indigenous Ecological Knowledges and Geographic Information Systems: Exploring ontologically Compatible Techniques and Technologies.&amp;quot; The workshop was an international interdisciplinary group of Indigenous scholars, cultural practitioners, students and non-Indigenous scholars working with or for Indigenous communities to discuss the development of spatial data infrastructure (SDI) capable of representing Indigenous perspectives of modeling environmental phenomena. The organizer of the workshop, the late Dr. Deanna Kingston of Oregon State University, concluded at the completion of the workshop, &amp;quot;We learned two things: 1. Each Indigenous community as well as each academic discipline is at a different developmental stage of understanding, the who, what, when, where, and why of SDI representation, which means we needed to collectively identify the starting point and path for this kind of project. 2. One of the points of collective agreement was the necessity of relating to our environments through sustainable principles, protocols, and practices (Hi&amp;apos;iaka Working Group, 2011).&amp;quot; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The WIS2DOM workshop will build on the lessons learned from the first workshop, by facilitating the concluding perspective that indigenous peoples who maintain a strong connection with their territory through subsistence or sustainable agriculture have a deep spatial knowledge that fully integrates humans into the natural world, a knowledge that is not fundamentally different from the developing transdisciplinary science of sustainability. The PIs maintain that despite holding a similar vision of sustaining resilient landscapes, Indigenous and sustainability sciences have not entered into dialogue on how to accomplish this common goal. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research team and organizers of this workshop recognize the value of ontological pluralism with regard to advancing scientific research and through this proposed workshop, will bring Indigenous and sustainability scientists into dialogue in order to diversify methods toward meeting common goals. The PIs recognize that dialogue across ontological boundaries poses significant challenges, but believe that the relationship between Indigenous and sustainability science is not dichotomous but is instead significantly complimentary. This project proposes to create a welcoming space for the exchange of ideas and concepts between what have previously been conceptualized as very divergent knowledge systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>In agent-based systems, agents can team in different combinations to cooperatively solve problems. Teaming, however, requires that agents understand each other and commit to concerted actions. In open, evolving networked systems, universal understanding and commitment are unlikely; instead, agents should congregate with those agents that they can understand and with whom they have successfully teamed in the past. Agent congregations are defined by commitments to common semantics and ontologies (conceptualizations of the world). Congregating improves the efficiency of communication and the likelihood of successful teaming. It can, however, impede the formation of effective teams whose members cross congregations, because agents need to learn new ontologies and incur overhead in searching for new congregations that meet their preferences. This project investigates how agent congregations are formed and how and when they should be reformed. The research includes simulations of large communities of agents, formal models of agency, and prototype systems. Its results will help guide the development of a national computing and communication infrastructure that supports the evolving identities and interests of scientific, educational, and commercial communities, and encourages communication between different communities. http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/wpb/conagents/</Abstract>

<Abstract>Computer Science (31)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project uses the new ISO standard for organizing, retrieving, and interchanging semantic information on the Web, Topic Maps, for developing e-learning courseware in computer science. Specifically, the project is developing subject ontologies for four modules of undergraduate Computer Science courses, using them to create comprehensive Topic Maps-based learning materials, and utilizing the developed materials in Web-assisted courses to assess their impact on student learning. The project is proving that a concept-based organization is an efficient form of structuring digital learning content in STEM disciplines and especially in Computer Science, as well as proving that Topic Maps technology is suitable for developing efficiently searchable and reusable educational materials on the Web. The topic map editor and viewer are available through the NSDL and the project is developing workshops for persons who want to develop their own topic-map based software.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project&amp;apos;s intellectual merit lies in concept-based organization of educational materials, providing grounds for improving students&amp;apos; learning in STEM disciplines by supporting topic-aware content browsing and context-based information retrieval. The developed Topic Maps-based Computer Science modules will serve as a model of ontology-driven courseware.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project&amp;apos;s broader impacts on courseware developers comes from promoting the application of ontologies for e-learning and using the new Topic Maps standard, and on learners, by developing courseware that provides guidance in self-exploration and task-related information search, especially for students with difficulties in conceptual understanding and reasoning.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A vast amount of work globally is going into making collections accessible utilizing technologies that can digitize, and circulate knowledge via informational networks. Libraries, Archives, Museums, and other traditional institutions of knowledge and information are at the forefront of these initiatives. The overwhelming response to the challenge of linking disparate collections via the process of digitization has been to standardize systems of classification and description. These processes of standardization are motivated by the need to catalogue ever-growing digital collections to enable users to access them more efficiently and uncover connections between objects. However, a key question has emerged: Are the representations placed around these knowledge objects by museums, etc. created from a deep knowledge of the context, cultural use, and meaning of the objects to which they refer? Scholars of standardization themselves acknowledge that with the goal of rapid retrieval, the meaning and description of the object may in turn be sacrificed. In practice, what has emerged has been a discontinuity between the efficiency-driven priorities of the public institution and the diverse contexts from which these objects of knowledge were produced. In this sense, knowledge that is developed and circulated within a localized and culturally-specific environment is decontextualized into an information system that maintains ad-hoc externally-imposed standards devoid of contextual meaning. This proposal, a collaboration between Dr. Ramesh Srinivasan and the University of Cambridge&amp;apos;s Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology (via senior personnel and Assistant Director, Dr. Robin Boast, is (1) to begin to analyze and articulate the differences between ad-hoc external standards versus localized culturally contextualized articulations of knowledge, and (2) the design, deployment, and evaluation of an information system that can accommodate multiple local interpretations of objects without sacrificing the interoperability of data within the system. It involves a 3 year effort with two global indigenous communities that have already opened their doors to collaboration with the PI/Museum that build on previous partnerships. These are: The Zuni Community of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico (USA), and another community in the process of being determined. Several possibilities are being discussed and will be finalized within the next three months. This research therefore extends significant work conducted in standards development, digital libraries, and social studies of science, particularly focused on ontologies and classifications that are culturally and discursively differentiated. The contributions and broader impacts of this proposal will be: (a) The detailed and methodical inquiry into the differing representations/ontologies of digital objects held within local, indigenous communities relative to their representation in existing digital museum standard-systems, (b) An understanding of the impact digital objects and their re-circulation hold on their originating communities. These impacts will be understood and described via a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods that include survey-administered social network analyses, field notes, participant observation, and interviews. (c) An understanding of how digital collections can maintain contextual authenticity while remaining interoperable. (d) Develop a new methodology by which public institutions can maintain digital collections in a manner that consults source communities, as well as other diverse knowledge communities. (e) An integration of this research into new research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project explores new ways of searching, organizing, preserving, and interacting with large information resources in the humanities and the social sciences. It involves the creation and support of a digital library of materials of significant international importance drawn from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Digital Archives (which includes image, sound, video and textual data), and the encoding, annotation, and multi-modal linkage of a portion of the collection to develop state-of-the-art methods for search and retrieval. The goal is to establish methods and procedures that can be later applied to the full FDR collection, and to consider the best means to enable flexible and creative access to this important resource. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project involves, on the one hand, computer scientists with significant experience in the representation of and access to on-line data, together with historians who require sophisticated and intelligent access to on-line historical resources. Because we will apply techniques from several technical fields to data that is typical of the humanities, the project represents an important cross-disciplinary effort. Another benefit is the collaboration between two undergraduate liberal arts institutions, Marist College and Vassar College, and the potential to involve students from both institutions in cutting edge research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project examines several areas of research related to theorem proving techniques for multiple-valued logics (MVL&amp;apos;s) and for proving completeness: - The most important work may be a new rule of inference, a resolution-like rule tentatively named Modification, for regular MVL&amp;apos;s. It appears likely that Modification is more effective than existing methods of inference for MVL&amp;apos;s; it is also likely that the insights provided by Modification can be adapted to improve the search behavior of other MVL inference rules. - Signed logic is an adaptation of classical logic for reasoning about MVL&amp;apos;s. Several modest implementations have been developed recently for signed logic. The current project will broaden the focus to implementations in the general theorem proving setting. Experiments with logic programming and constraint solving will also be undertaken. - Annotated logic corresponds to a naturally arising class of signed logic and has been applied to reasoning with inconsistency. Current systems of annotated logic are paraconsistent, that is, inconsistency tolerant, with respect to epistemic inconsistency, but they behave classically with respect to ontological inconsistency. A mapping from signed logic to annotated logic has been defined which has the effect of mapping ontological inconsistency to epistemic inconsistency. Further investigation into properties of this mapping in the proposed project is expected to lead to fruitful insights on the relationships between the two notions of inconsistencies. - The Anderson-Bledsoe excess literal proof of the completeness of resolution was recently generalized to provide simplified proofs of known results as well as to prove completeness of connected tableaux and of connected regular tableaux for NNF formulas and the completeness of linear non-clausal resolution. The project will examine the application of the technique to still other methods of proof procedures.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This CONACyT research project will enable a research group at the University of South Carolina to cooperate with a research group at the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Mexico City, Mexico. Together they will develop a methodology that enables software agents with different ontologies to interact and exchange information. The objectives are to increase the ease with which such software can be produced and its robustness. Under this approach, software development would consist of choosing among &amp;quot;volunteers&amp;quot; (agents from an active repository) and assembling them into a problem-solving team, instead of debugging lines of code. Software development would be more like coaching and less like traditional programming. The research will explore 1) how independently constructed autonomous agents reach mutual understanding, 2) what categories of software are suitable for team-oriented programming, and 3) how team behaviors can be analyzed and validated. Groups of students will assemble agent-based software systems and compare the resulting systems for robustness with software developed conventionally. The two resarch sites will collaborate through online meetings, the exchange of graduate students and mutual visits to each other&amp;apos;s research centers.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Interested in the relationship between technological advance and the nature and classification of disease, this Science and Technology Studies Dissertation Research Improvement Grant will examine innovations in prosthetic science and the medical phenomenon known as phantom limb syndrome (PLS). Broadly, this work will constitute a socio-cultural and historical analysis of the modernization of dismemberment, interested in the expansion and sophistication of technologies used to replace parts of the body lost to amputation, and the modification of PLS in terms of classification, causal assumptions and treatment options. This qualitative project will employ a number of research methods including semi-structured, open-ended interviews; analysis of historical and archival data; content analysis of medical literature published on phantom limb from 1930 to the present; review of online resources and documents; and review of mainstream and alternative media. NSF funds will support interviews with key researchers working on aspects of PL including aspects of theorizing, characterizing, prevalence, pain, and treatment, will be conducted in person. Efforts will be made at each site to visit lab space, observe work and interview other relevant persons. The intellectual merit of this project includes a socio-cultural analysis of dismemberment. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Dismemberment is an issue extensively discussed in the clinical literature, implicated in the disability literature, and alluded to within the recent wave of theories of embodiment interested in experiential or lived accounts. Notably absent is a theoretically informed socio-cultural examination of the intersection of dismemberment and technologies of the body. Further, this work contributes to the sub-discipline of medical sociology. Medical sociology takes seriously the role of sciences, technologies and medicines in the production of contemporary epistemological and ontological concerns. Projects that theorize and investigate the cultural, discursive, institutional and/or relational aspects of health, healing, wellness, illness and death, are considered core contributions to the field. The proposed work integrates an examination of the knowledges, techniques, and technologies relevant to part-loss, part-replacement, and lived partiality. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;More broadly, in recent years, social scientists have begun to theorize both about and from the body. This project attempts to connect these concerns directly with the study of science and technology. Thus, this work will contribute to: 1) the analytic import of the body as an object and site of inquiry; and 2) the theoretical juxtaposition of technologies of the body with both the social body and individual bodies (in this case-amputees). In addition, this project is sensitive to epistemological, ontological, ethical/moral and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;political concerns regarding bio-technological joinings and engages directly with the multifaceted techno phobic/philic divide. Practically, the synthesis and analysis of knowledge concerning dismemberment, phantom limb syndrome and prosthetic science: 1) will function to inform future research in this area; and 2) may be valuable as a resource to amputees and others.</Abstract>

<Abstract>TITLE ITR: Automated Trust Negotiation in Open Systems&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI Kent Seamons &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;co-PIs Ninghui Li&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; John Mitchell&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Brian Tung&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; William Winsborough&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Marianne Winslett&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Automated trust negotiation (ATN) is a new approach to access control and authentication for the open, flexible systems formed by sets of organizations that must dynamically form coalitions and work together to respond to unforeseen needs and opportunities. ATN enables open computing by assigning an access control policy to each resource that is to be made accessible to &amp;quot;outsiders&amp;quot;; an attempt to access the resource triggers a trust negotiation, consisting of the iterative, bilateral disclosure of digital credentials and related information. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will show that ATN is a practical solution to the access control and authentication problems of open computing systems, by resolving the most critical remaining theoretical and systems issues for the deployment of trust negotiation facilities. Specific areas that the project will address include access control policy languages for ATN, light-weight policy evaluation engines, improved ATN protocols and strategies compatible with the new languages, provable privacy and autonomy guarantees for negotiating parties, and a next-generation version of the TrustBuilder ATN prototype, demonstrating the deployment of ATN in a modular, reusable, and highly scalable implementation. These enhancements will be explored in the context of health care applications and additional scenarios supplied by the project partners.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is devoted to building a large multilingual semantic network&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;through the application of novel techniques for semantic analysis&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;specifically targeted at the Wikipedia corpus. The driving hypothesis of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the project is that the structure of Wikipedia can be effectively used to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;create a highly structured graph of world knowledge in which nodes&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;correspond to entities and concepts described in Wikipedia, while edges&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;capture ontological relations such as hypernymy and meronymy. Special&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;emphasis is given to exploiting the multilingual information available in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Wikipedia in order to improve the performance of each semantic analysis&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tool. Significant research effort is therefore aimed at developing tools&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for word sense disambiguation, reference resolution and the extraction of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ontological relations that use multilingual reinforcement and the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;consistent structure and focused content of Wikipedia to solve these tasks&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;accurately. An additional research challenge is the effective integration&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of inherently noisy evidence from multiple Wikipedia articles in order to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;increase the reliability of the overall knowledge encoded in the global&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Wikipedia graph. Computing probabilistic confidence values for every piece&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of structural information added to the network is an important step in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;this integration, and it is also meant to provide increased utility for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;downstream applications. The proposed highly structured semantic network&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;complements existing semantic resources and is expected to have a broad&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;impact on a wide range of natural language processing applications in need&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of large scale world knowledge.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information, please see the project website:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Mu.Se.Net</Abstract>

<Abstract>0618986&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Gross&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will develop a cyberinfrastructure prototype (the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Observatory, CBEO) to provide integrated access to a broad array of established monitoring databases, as well as streaming data sources and historical simulations from hydrodynamic models for Chesapeake Bay. The proposed work leverages and extends CI components, metadata standards, and ontologies developed for other observatory networks and includes four interdependent efforts: a prototype test bed effort (CBEO:T), a GEON-based node (CBEO:N), use of CBEO:T and CBEO:N to address science questions related to hypoxia in the system (CBEO:S) and an outreach and education component (CBEO:E). &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Scientific questions the PIs seek to address relate to hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay, specifically to improve understanding of (1) the processes causing hypoxia by reconciling predictions from mechanistic models with field observations; (2) inter-annual co-variation of river flows and hypoxia, and (3) regional and seasonal balances between sources and sinks of organic matter that regulate oxygen consumption and hypoxia in bottom waters of the Bay. Novel approaches to data integration will be studied, and the development of &amp;quot;cross-walks&amp;quot; between controlled vocabularies and metadata standards used by several existing observatory efforts plus ontological concept mapping to be conducted by the node development team will contribute to parallel efforts in other networks. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will provide educational opportunities through partnerships with Sea Grant, NSF&amp;apos;s COSEE-MA, and Hampton University&amp;apos;s MAST multi-cultural program. Direct participation of multicultural students and a K-12 teacher are planned. The work will benefit a wide array of local stakeholders by providing powerful new ways to integrate and visualize data and information about Chesapeake Bay and will provide validation and field testing of tools and concepts developed by emerging environmental observatory networks and initiatives, thus serving to inform CI development in other networks facing similar problems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The biological databases provide a rich source of data to serve as training data for statistical and machine learning approaches to text mining; they also provide expert-curated, &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; data for evaluation of system performance. The strategy is to focus on problems of importance to working biologists, such as overcoming the curation bottleneck for biological literature, providing better mappings between biological ontologies and text, and giving biologists better access to textual information in both in the literature and in curated databases. This proposal focuses on development of mechanisms to promote progress in text mining to problems of biological significance. The short term focus is to continue work in organizing BioCreAtIvE: Critical Assessment for Information Extraction in Biology. The long term focus is to improve text mining tools to support expert curators in their cost-effective acquisition of information for biological databases, as well as to improve access to biological information via the use of shared semantics (ontologies), with particular focus on interactive tools and extraction of complex relations, such as host-pathogen or ecosystem interactions. The specific tasks proposed here are 1) running the Gene Normalization task for BioCreAtIvE II (to take place in 2006-2007) and analyzing and disseminating the data and results of the BioCreAtIvE II; 2) providing input into the creation of a Roadmap for BioCreAtIvE; 3) defining new evaluation tasks to meet needs of a wider range of biological curators; this will include an evaluation of interactive curation tools, done in conjunction with the RegCreative Jamboree; and methods for the representation and capture of complex biological relations, such as host-pathogen interaction and ecosystem interactions, in conjunction with standards consortia.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to produce a software application that enables business people to dramatically improve their ability to forecast supply and demand. In collaboration with the Knowledge Modeling Group at Stanford Medical Informatics, Clados proposes a joint effort to produce relevant aggregation to investigate supply and demand. The effort will proceed in three stages: (1) Capture interactions in OWL from a &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; set of investment research reports; (2) Produce meaningful Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) aggregations on all interactions using the OWL representation directly; and, (3) Evaluate the results by capturing and aggregating interactions from a &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; set of reports.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Business people focus heavily on composing narratives to gauge potential supply and demand to guide their investment decisions. In recent years, society has benefited from dramatic increases in volume and availability of information that business people find useful in composing these narratives. However, most people compose those narratives using only the most general tools, predominantly prose documents and spreadsheet tables, and these are insufficient to structure such volume. As a result, society has an opportunity to further improve resource allocation. OLAP technologies may dramatically improve the process of composing narratives to gauge potential supply and demand.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The primary goal of this project is to research and develop the use of the qualitative reasoning paradigm for providing intelligent support to the preliminary aspects of simulation model design. Specifically, the research will be targeted at the application of qualitative reasoning to the description validation and the conceptual model design activities. In order to achieve this goal, the specific Phase II objectives are to develop ontologies for a specific manufacturing system domain and the simulation modeling domain; to extract and formalize Common Sense Principles of System Operation; to refine the IDEF3 model- theoretic semantics; to research and prototype a qualitative reasoning engine comprising ontological and common sense reasoning components; and to demonstrate the application of this qualitative reasoning engine to the tasks of description validation and conceptual model design. The main benefits of the proposed research will be to provide intelligent support for the initial analysis and model design tasks of the simulation modeling proces; to enhance the productivity of both the domain expert nd the simulation analyst; and to enhance the acceptance of simulation modeling techniques by decision makers in industry and business. The results of this research have the potential to make a significant impact on the state-of-the-art in simulation modeling technology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project funded by the Science, Technology &amp;amp; Society Program examines how different forms of social classification -- from high brow to low brow, from scientific to popular, from state-directed to society-driven -- relate to one another within a particular society, and explains their common origins in the institutional and political make-up that supports them. The PI investigates the existence of national classificatory styles through a detailed analysis of the emergence and development of three debates over classification in America and France: the ranking of wines, the digitization of books and the economic valuation of nature. The unfolding and settlement of these debates in each country are followed, and narratives are drawn together by showing the common institutional and cultural logics at work across them, in spite of their large differences in origin, purpose and function. By systematically embedding classificatory activities in particular discursive repertoires and institutional environments, this project makes an important contribution to our understanding of how people come to construct the world in a particular way, as well as to our appreciation of the political and economic force of these representations. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;At a material level, each of the case studies undertaken for this project is the occasion for the PI to work closely with one research assistant. The project thus contributes to the training of three graduate students, draws them together as a team working on parallel issues and stimulates their interest in the intersection between technology, knowledge and politics. Second, at the analytical level, the project bridges an important disciplinary gap by connecting the philosophical and historical literature on measurement and value in science studies with the abundant literature in sociology and political science that deals with cross-national variations in institutional systems and cultural representations, thereby contributing to enrich both literatures. Finally, at a more metaphysical level, this project fosters a better understanding of the institutional, economic, and cultural basis of knowledge that could be useful in many applied domains -- including cross-cultural psychology, consulting, economic activity and policy. It draws attention to the importance of technologies of classification and measure in carrying out certain visions of the social order and in explaining why some of these visions become focal points for political contention and economic conflict, as is the case in all three domains singled out for empirical examination.</Abstract>

Regli (Drexel University)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Senior Personnel: Joseph B. Kopena (Drexel University)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research investigates scalable, knowledge-based middleware supporting content-based addressing and routing in mobile, networked systems. It incorporates and integrates two aspects: Ontological reasoning about system resources and declarative networking within routing components. At the application layer is OntoNet, a knowledge-based framework for representing and reasoning on system elements. Declarative, formal techniques provide service discovery and composition, content-based messaging, and distributed querying using OWL-Net, a subset of the OWL description logic. This work includes development of propagation strategies that are efficient and robust in mobile, networked environments. Network layer support is provided by declarative networks, a rule-based framework for compact, high-level protocol specifications. Declarative networking enables rapid prototyping and verification as well as online adaptation and meta-reasoning. This research will include extension of declarative networking to more readily support highly dynamic mobile wireless systems. The intellectual merit of this proposal is development of a unified, declarative framework for distributed organization of knowledge and information in real-world systems. It draws from many areas such as the Semantic Web, databases, and networking. Potential broader impacts are richer and more extensible platforms for real-world networks usable in emergency response, logistics, infrastructure monitoring, and ubiquitous computing.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award supports the preparation and sharing of computational neuroscience data as part of a new component of the CRCNS program aimed at catalyzing rapid and innovative advances in computational neuroscience and related fields. Through a collaborative effort of many laboratories, this project combines knowledge about the nervous systems of several important gastropod model systems, including Aplysia, Clione, Helisoma, Helix (Cantareus), Hermissenda, Limax, Lymnaea, Melibe, Pleurobranchaea, and Tritonia, in an effort to lay the foundation for future comparative neuromics in gastropods.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Just as comparative genomics has enabled researchers to understand the evolution and development of organisms in terms of similarities and differences in their genomes, comparative neuromics, the comparison of neurons and their connections across species, offers unprecedented opportunities to increase our understanding of nervous system structure and function. Gastropod molluscs are uniquely suited for neuromic analysis because they have large individually identifiable neurons and work has proceeded for over four decades on species ranging from terrestrial and aquatic pulmonates to marine opisthobranchs, which inhabit diverse ecological niches. This project will consolidate the published knowledge about gastropod neurons and neural circuits into a searchable, extensible knowledge base, to be rendered in a format that can be federated with other knowledge repositories and primary data sources. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will build on currently available web-based tools and coordinate with other related efforts, such as NeuronBank, Open Biomedical Ontologies, and neuroscience-specific ontologies being developed for the Biomedical Informatics Research Network and the Neuroscience Information Framework. The gastropod user community is involved in providing sources of information and testing the outcome of the project to assure the accuracy of the representation and the usability of the format. Consolidating the vast amount of accumulated knowledge about gastropod nervous systems is essential for the expanded use of these model organisms as genomic tools become available through the Aplysia genome project and other initiatives. This project will serve as a basis for federating other databases including neuronal morphology, neuronal and neural circuit computational simulations, and signal transduction pathways. It will also serve as a proof of concept for larger research communities with more disparate nervous systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project examines several areas of research related to theorem proving techniques for multiple-valued logics (MVL&amp;apos;s) and for proving completeness: - The most important work may be a new rule of inference, a resolution-like rule tentatively named Modification, for regular MVL&amp;apos;s. It appears likely that Modification is more effective than existing methods of inference for MVL&amp;apos;s; it is also likely that the insights provided by Modification can be adapted to improve the search behavior of other MVL inference rules. - Signed logic is an adaptation of classical logic for reasoning about MVL&amp;apos;s. Several modest implementations have been developed recently for signed logic. The current project will broaden the focus to implementations in the general theorem proving setting. Experiments with logic programming and constraint solving will also be undertaken. - Annotated logic corresponds to a naturally arising class of signed logic and has been applied to reasoning with inconsistency. Current systems of annotated logic are paraconsistent, that is, inconsistency tolerant, with respect to epistemic inconsistency, but they behave classically with respect to ontological inconsistency. A mapping from signed logic to annotated logic has been defined which has the effect of mapping ontological inconsistency to epistemic inconsistency. Further investigation into properties of this mapping in the proposed project is expected to lead to fruitful insights on the relationships between the two notions of inconsistencies. - The Anderson-Bledsoe excess literal proof of the completeness of resolution was recently generalized to provide simplified proofs of known results as well as to prove completeness of connected tableaux and of connected regular tableaux for NNF formulas and the completeness of linear non-clausal resolution. The project will examine the application of the technique to still other methods of proof procedures.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Targeted Research project is investigating the merger of the information retrieval (IR) and digital reference components of the National STEM Education Digital Library (NSDL). Combining these functions enables users to find answers to questions regardless if those answers come from documents in NSDL collections or experts accessible through the NSDL&amp;apos;s virtual reference desk. The project is using large digital reference data sets of question/answer pairs with human judgments to create ontologies of questions. These ontologies supplement automatic question triage techniques to create an enhanced NSDL IR system. The project is also developing methodologies for the creation of inductive expert profiles to allow the enhanced IR system to route questions needing human intermediation quickly and effectively.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Interoperation between systems which use extensive formalized knowledge&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is hampered by the wide variety of formalisms currently in use in such&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;systems. Attempts to create World-wide Web standards have already&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;yielded a collection of such formalisms, not all mutually compatible. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This situation results in part from a methodology which views deductive&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;efficiency of inference engines, rather than semantic clarity, as the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;primary design criterion for new formalisms. Recent work (reviving an &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;older idea) has focussed instead on the design of a single, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;highly expressive, logic into which a wide number of existing &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;formalisms can be straightforwardly mapped, essentially treating &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;them as subsets or simple ontologies (theories) within the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;single common formalism. The resulting logic, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;called the Interoperation Knowledge Language (IKL), &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;can express many representational strategies and the relationships&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;between them in a single formalism, in principle overcoming this &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interoperation problem in many common cases. To realize this potential &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in practice requires an inference engine to process IKL.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Although IKL is more expressive than first-order logic and so is&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;not decidable, many of the formalisms translated into it have very &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tractable inference behavior. This project implements a new design &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of a reasoner which is theoretically complete for IKL, while also having&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the ability to recognize many of the known tractable subcases and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;use efficient inference strategies on inputs which fit into these &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;known cases. The behavior of the engine is directed by scripts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;which control its search behavior in a highly flexible multi-directional &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;search space combining hyper-resolution, rule-saturation and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tableaux reasoning. The engine is designed as an experimental &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;workbench rather than a production engine, with a focus on inventing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;useful techniques for controlling its behavior, running large&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;experiment suites semi-automatically, and gathering information &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;relevant to the search process. We plan to make use of this engine&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;in a series of projects devoted to learning new inference strategies &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;from empirical ontological data. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The code created by this project will be publicly available &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Details of the project can be found on the project web page at &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://homam.ihmc.us/silkie/Home.html</Abstract>

<Abstract>The landscape is a fundamental component of the human experience. Yet until recently, the study of these larger parts of the human environment has been fragmented among the disciplines and often has been appended to studies of more proximate environments. This award supports a transdisciplinary workshop that will bring together a range of perspectives on how landscape is represented in language, and what this reveals about the relationships of people to the land. Workshop participants will address several key questions. Are there cross-cultural and cross-linguistic variations in the delimitation, classification, and naming of geographic features? What are the similarities across languages, and how great are the differences? Can alternative world-views, as expressed in representations of landforms, be utilized to produce appropriate culturally-specific Geographic Information Systems (GIS)? The workshop will discuss these and related questions and involve about two dozen scholars from a range of disciplines: anthropologists, geographers, information scientists, linguists, philosophers, and others. The workshop will build on the long-term collaboration between the &amp;apos;Ethnophysiography&amp;apos; research project (David Mark, Andrew Turk and David Stea) and researchers at the Max Planck Institution (MPI) for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen (Netherlands) (Stephen Levinson, Niclas Burenhult, and others), a leading center for research on cross-cultural variations in language and thought. Researchers in the MPI&amp;apos;s Language and Cognition Group have recently concluded a set of case studies of landscape terms (and place names) in nine languages in a wide variety of geographic locations. Researchers from those two groups constitute the workshop organizing committee. The remaining invited participants are from other institutions and disciplines, selected to compliment the strengths of the MPI and &amp;apos;Ethnophysiography&amp;apos; participants. To ensure the presence of &amp;apos;new blood&amp;apos; and alternative perspectives, the remaining participants will be selected from researchers who respond to an open call for participation. The workshop will combine standard paper presentations and discussion sessions with field experiences. The field trips will provide grounding for the discussions of theory and principles. The majority of the meeting will be held at Chinle, Arizona, on the Navajo Reservation, at the mouth of Canyon de Chelly. The program also will include a half day in Window Rock, capital of the Navajo Nation, where we plan for workshop participants to meet with tribal officials with responsibilities related to GIS or to cultural preservation. At the workshop&amp;apos;s other sessions, participants will summarize their recent work and discuss research themes, including: semantics of landscape terms; the role and construction of geographic names (toponyms); topophilia; conceptual frameworks (ontologies); and relations to indigenous mapping and GIS. Discussion sessions will aim to reach consensus on research issues and priorities. These should include, but not be limited to: ontologies for comparing landscape terms and concepts cross-linguistically; factors that may influence the nature of terms and concepts adopted and used by a speech community; relationships of spiritual aspects of culture to landscape terms and toponyms; research methods, especially field methods; and discussion of ethical dimensions of the research, and its potential value to the indigenous communities involved in the research. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Outcomes of the workshop will include research priorities for the study of the relationships between language, culture, and landscape. We expect new insights on this important research topic to arise during the workshop and to activate new research programs that will advance knowledge of how people conceptualize and communicate about the landscape. Workshop outcomes also should improve the theoretical basis for computerized Indigenous GIS and mapping systems. The workshop also will contribute to methods for documenting and preserving domain-specific language and culture related to landscape. Broader impact also will result from the participation of early career scholars from several disciplines, and from workshop publications (likely a special issue of a journal). Diversity will be emphasized in the recruitment of the early-career participants. Holding the majority of the workshop on the Navajo Reservation will contribute to the local economy and provide opportunities for native-American students and others to participate in the workshop.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This is a project to develop a new approach to interruptibility and related issues in instant messaging (IM) and mobile communications. Computer mediated communication is hampered by impoverished social cues related to when it is appropriate for an information system to interrupt a person or carry out some other action that might be appropriate at some times and not others. This problem is more pronounced when computing becomes more pervasive and as people are increasingly always online and always reachable. In the case of IM, the old method of alerting users to one&amp;apos;s status no longer functions well. Although computers have access to many embedded sensors, automated assistance for alleviating inappropriate IM interruptions remains elusive. In a world in which users are &amp;quot;&amp;quot;available&amp;quot;&amp;quot; for some purposes, but not for others, one indication of interruptibility no longer fits the needs of users. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research will explore how sensor data coupled with machine learning techniques and mass-collaboration could be leveraged to support users&amp;apos; social decisions. By learning users&amp;apos; preferred description of their place - in light of their position, activity, time, etc. - an intelligent user interface could present communication partners with information about a user&amp;apos;s current status, ideally their &amp;quot;&amp;quot;context.&amp;quot;&amp;quot; This shifts the burden of determining interruptibility from the realm of the computer to the social realm of the users, where it belongs. This approach treats context as an evolving communication of environmental data. Central to this approach is a way in which users are motivated to submit training data that translates sensor data to semantic labels. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The work will be carried out in three phases. Phase I: Development, deployment and testing of a context-aware IM client, Nomatic*Gaim. This client will be used as a data collection mechanism for mappings of sensor data to semantic labels that will train machine learning algorithms. Under the auspices of a controlled user study, this software will be deployed, and researchers will observe the language that humans use to disclose context. Phase II: Organic ontologies will be constructed from correlations in the data set using statistical tests. These ontologies will form a language structure on which the vocabulary of Phase I can be placed. The models from Phase I coupled with the structure learned in Phase II will be incorporated into a user interface that assists users with setting their context status and that gracefully degrades as confidence in predictions gets lower. Evaluations of this phase will be conducted using user-interface evaluation techniques that will quantitatively and qualitatively judge the effectiveness of automatic labeling. Phase III: The newly developed IM techniques will be incorporated into a mobile phone version of Nomatic*Gaim that will then be evaluated in a parallel study to Phase I. This will enable researchers to understand differences between laptop and cell-phone mobility. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research will push the boundaries of effective social communication in an &amp;quot;&amp;quot;always online&amp;quot;&amp;quot; culture. Effective semantic context labeling promises to have a broader impact on computing by becoming a resource which prompts software to act in new ways. For example, when a user is in a library the volume of their device can be lowered; when a user is on a boat, tide tables and maritime weather reports can be automatically obtained and displayed more prominently. The software and research artifacts will be incorporated into existing undergraduate research plans and will help to seed the development of computer science curriculum organized around the idea of computing with location.</Abstract>

This project aims to make web-based, complex data integration into an activity that can be performed by individual scientists on an ad hoc basis, collecting, manipulating, and publishing precisely the information that they want to work with. We address three aspects of the data integration problem. The project has four tasks: (1) develop tools that let non-programmers collect the information they wish to integrate, extracting it from numerous non-cooperating web sites, or from data repositories with disparate schemata, and structuring it into an integrated data model, (2) develop ontologies and tools that let users build their own task-specific information management applications, (3) develop ontologies and tools that let users build their own task-specific information management applications. The work will be evaluated by assembling a broad reference corpus of web data sources, primarily in biology, and measuring the ability of the components to collect, integrate, and redisseminate data from these sources. In addition, formative and summative user studies of the tools will be performed in the lab, tools will be deployed for biologists&amp;apos;use in their own work.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Project summary According to a mechanistic view of explanation, scientists explain a phenomenon by revealing how it works or came to be. Mechanism is often associated with explanatory monism, which is the view that a phenomenon is best accounted for by a single explanation. If a phenomenon has one causal history or one set of parts, and a mechanistic explanation is a description of that history or those parts, then it seems natural to expect there to be a single correct explanation for a phenomenon. However, biology is rife with explanatory pluralism. There are many biological phenomena that seem to require, multiple explanations. Rather than use this pluralism to characterize biology as less scientific than physics, philosophers of biology have developed systematic accounts of pluralism. None of these philosophical accounts of explanatory pluralism address philosophers&amp;apos; best understanding of mechanistic explanation. This is surprising since most biological explanations are mechanistic. Also, the philosophy of biology and science studies lacks an account of the role that epistemic factors related to pluralism play in the creation of mechanistic explanations of biological phenomena. We need such an account in order to understand explanatory pluralism in the context of mechanistic explanation. This project will use the methods of naturalized philosophy of biology to develop a view of mechanistic explanation, pragmatic mechanism, which takes philosophical accounts of explanatory pluralism in biology seriously. According to pragmatic mechanism it is necessary but not sufficient that a mechanistic explanation be a description of a mechanism. A mechanistic explanation must also reflect the ways that different biological disciplines individuate mechanisms and must be consistent with local traditions of reasoning and experimentation in biological research programs. The PI will write a 9 chapter book of interest to philosophers, historians and sociologists of science, as well as biologists and those interested in considering how explanatory strategies in science affect the retention of women in science and our understanding of female biology. Further, three articles will be written for particular audiences in philosophy, science studies and women&amp;apos;s studies. The research for those articles and arguments developed in those articles will be developed in relevant sections of the book. In terms of intellectual merit the project involves a close reading of the biological literature related to the evolution of sexual reproduction, which is a problem of central importance in evolutionary biology. Second, it develops a novel account of pluralism that focuses on interactions of ontological, pragmatic and epistemological factors. Third, this project involves an epistemic and pragmatic analysis of mechanistic explanation, which is primarily studied from an ontological point of view. Pragmatic mechanism advances our understanding of biological pluralism by giving an account of pluralism that is seriously engaged with our strongest theories of mechanistic explanation. This view has implications for our understanding of interdisciplinary research, scientific objectivity and the status of women in science and research into female biology. In terms of broader impact the project integrates research and education by involving an undergraduate research assistant who will take an independent study course and will be used to develop a graduate course, Women in Science. The PI will use this research to develop a graduate minor on women in science that will make connections among faculty studying gender and science in five science and humanities departments. This research will benefit society by providing a set of prescriptions to help us understand and more successfully engage in interdisciplinary research. Further, pragmatic mechanism ameliorates many feminist concerns about mechanistic explanations of women&amp;apos;s biology and has the potential to help us conduct scientific research that more directly meets women&amp;apos;s needs. Finally, this research broadens opportunities and enables the participation of women in science by developing an understanding of how the social factors involved in scientific reasoning can be developed to better meet the needs of women scientists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is devoted to building a large multilingual semantic network&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;through the application of novel techniques for semantic analysis&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;specifically targeted at the Wikipedia corpus. The driving hypothesis of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the project is that the structure of Wikipedia can be effectively used to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;create a highly structured graph of world knowledge in which nodes&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;correspond to entities and concepts described in Wikipedia, while edges&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;capture ontological relations such as hypernymy and meronymy. Special&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;emphasis is given to exploiting the multilingual information available in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Wikipedia in order to improve the performance of each semantic analysis&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;tool. Significant research effort is therefore aimed at developing tools&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for word sense disambiguation, reference resolution and the extraction of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ontological relations that use multilingual reinforcement and the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;consistent structure and focused content of Wikipedia to solve these tasks&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;accurately. An additional research challenge is the effective integration&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of inherently noisy evidence from multiple Wikipedia articles in order to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;increase the reliability of the overall knowledge encoded in the global&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Wikipedia graph. Computing probabilistic confidence values for every piece&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of structural information added to the network is an important step in&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;this integration, and it is also meant to provide increased utility for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;downstream applications. The proposed highly structured semantic network&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;complements existing semantic resources and is expected to have a broad&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;impact on a wide range of natural language processing applications in need&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of large scale world knowledge.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information, please see the project website:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Mu.Se.Net</Abstract>

<Abstract>Broad coverage dictionaries and ontologies for natural language processing (NLP) are difficult and costly to create and maintain by hand. It is therefore desirable to learn them from distributional information, such as can be obtained from unlabeled or sparsely labeled text corpora. Many linguistic and psycholinguistic theories are distributional, but emphasize local neighborhood structure more than do previous NLP approaches. Successful visualization techniques such as keyword-in-context also rely on the preservation of neighborhood structure. A similar emphasis is present in emerging techniques for data reduction, such as LLE and min-cut algorithms, whose application to language data the project is investigating.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;While the immediate goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of lexical tuning and acquisition, the resulting dictionaries, ontologies and mapping techniques have the potential to help information professionals (such as librarians, translators, patent examiners and paralegal researchers) to navigate through corpora, to understand the significance of the data that they see, and to incorporate insights derived from the data into their working practice.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI and his students are also integrating computational linguistics into the undergraduate curriculum of the Department of Linguistics and creating new courses designed primarily to appeal to students majoring in the humanities in order to offer such students fresh options in meeting the scientific, mathematical, and quantitative components of the university&amp;apos;s breadth requirement.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The effectiveness of instructors and efficiency of learners engaged in open-learning and teaching tasks in Web-based course support environments depend crucially on the support they receive: for learners in retrieving relevant information to perform their learning tasks and for instructors in creating and maintaining online teaching and learning material. Two groups of related problems concern correspondingly findability of learning resources and reusability and shareability of digital educational repositories. A solution to these problems is only viable if the digital content of the repositories is standards-based. Standardization of e-learning repositories should be addressed not only from a technological perspective but also from a knowledge perspective.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project provides a path to better understanding and solving some problems related to efficient retrieval, sharing, reuse, and interchange of discipline-specific repositories of learning objects on the Web. An in-depth analysis of the application of the new ISO standard, Topic Maps, within the framework of NSDL reveals how it compares to other Semantic Web solutions along similar dimensions. The concept-based architecture of digital course libraries provides grounds for efficient context-based retrieval of learning resources as well as for deeper understanding of the ontological structure of the specific subject domain. The topic maps-based implementation of the architecture provides a unifying framework for standards-based knowledge and information representation and management, which implies reusability, shareability, and interoperability of the learning content. The developed environment for supporting ontology-aware digital course libraries offers an alternative solution to courseware authors and users, which in some cases could meet better their needs.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project impacts Web-based educational systems and digital libraries communities including designers, developers, and users (instructors, authors) of such systems, and through them on learners involved in various forms of education - formal, informal, and lifelong learning. It promotes the use of the new ISO standard Topic Maps for educational purposes and provides insight about the role that ontologies can play in digital libraries and instructional technology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This software tool improves the performance effectiveness of both learners and instructors in Web-based learning support environments.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal addresses one simple question: how can we develop effective multi-agent systems out of the exception-prone (buggy, malicious, or simply &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot;) agents and infrastructures we can expect to encounter in open system contexts? This problem will be addressed by developing technologies that can determine, at run time, what exceptions can occur, as well as what exception detection and resolution strategies are appropriate, for a dynamically changing agent population and system environment. This work&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;will build on two key ideas: (1) it is possible to identify highly reusable domain-independent exception handling expertise, and (2) this expertise can be instantiated in the form of distinct exception handling services that outsource exception handling from the agents, requiring only that they adhere to some relatively simple guidelines. The potential impact of this work will include (1) enabling the creation of multi-agent systems that can function effectively in open contexts, while (2) reducing the burden on agent developers by obviating the need to create agents with sophisticated exception handling capabilities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>ITR: iLearn: IT-enabled Ubiquitous Access to Educational Opportunities for Blind Individuals&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The overall objective of this project is to design and develop a ubiquitous computing environment (called iLearn-System) that can help blind and visually impaired students succeed in their educational endeavors. iLearn-System has three major components, each of which specifically addresses key hurdles faced by blind students: iLearn-Reader for reading printed material, ilearn-Interaction Assistant to facilitate interaction within a campus environment, and iLearn-Information-Assistant to enable easy access to on-line course material. The interface to these components is through an iLearn-Device, which integrates the different iLearn-System components. The scientific contributions of this work are in the domains of visual processing, information fusion, customized delivery of information to blind users adapted to context and task, speech processing and recognition, and prototype development. The impact of this project includes the empowerment of blind and visually impaired students to take full advantage of the educational opportunities and participate in the innovations that would result from the project. The applicability of iLearn-System is not only to the population of blind individuals, but also to other groups including those whose visual abilities are declining due to aging. The project results will be disseminated through an accessible web site, http://ilearn.asu.edu. This web site will collect feedback from parents, teachers, and other user groups. Nationally, or partners will disseminate iLearn-System at high schools and universities. An annual workshop disseminates our project results to all interested consumers, researchers, mobility instructors, and disability specialists.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The science education community and the published American standards about science literacy call for students to learn important science concepts and the skills involved in scientific reasoning in ways that allow them to apply what they are learning in new situations. The science education literature has identified classroom practices that seem essential to such deep and transferable learning. Several approaches to inquiry-driven project-based science have been designed based on these recommendations, and results show that when carried out by masterful teachers, both science content and practices are well learned. But we don&amp;apos;t know the developmental course of scientific reasoning skills when they are learned in a classroom context engineered for their transferable learning. Nor do we know the conditions that need to be in place to allow teachers and students to make best use of project-based learning&amp;apos;s affordances.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For the past five years, the Learning by Design group at Georgia Tech has been designing an inquiry-oriented project-based approach to middle-school science learning informed by research on how people learn. Our team has designed sequences of classroom practices that, as a system, promote deep understanding and lasting and reusable learning. The trends in our data suggest that science learning in our LBD classrooms is more comprehensive and more likely to transfer than the learning in more standard inquiry-oriented science classrooms.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We propose to use the infrastructure of LBD, our local LBD classrooms, and our cross-disciplinary team to investigate issues with respect to promoting transfer using a project-based inquiry approach, focusing especially on the learning of scientific reasoning skills and practices. Our Quadrant 2 questions ask about the development of scientific reasoning skills in a project-based science classroom, aiming to provide a bridge from basic research in cognitive science on transfer, scientific reasoning, and learning to the pragmatics of transfer and learning in the real world of the classroom. Our Quadrant 3 questions ask about conditions that need to be in place in the classroom for learning and transfer of science practices to occur.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Scientific reasoning skills are difficult to measure, but we have had some success in showing the acquisition of these skills by the students in our LBD classrooms. The challenge we take on here is to explore the development of this type of reasoning in middle school children at a fine-grained level. We will use a combination of design experiments and micro-genetic analysis.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We are aiming to use our LBD classrooms to find out more about the cognitive and socio-cognitive processes involved in learning science practices with several goals in mind: (i) better understanding of the processes involved in learning to reason scientifically; (ii) better understanding of classroom practices that will promote transferable learning; and (iii) the generation of guidelines for project-based science classrooms, about how to promote transferable learning of science practices.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Proposal 702764&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A Transformational Approach to Clone Refactoring &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI - Jeff Gray&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Surveys indicate that 10% of the code in many commercial applications may contain clones, which represent fragments of code that are duplicated throughout various source files. This presents a maintenance and evolution challenge when a code clone is changed because it is likely that the other corresponding clones require similar adaptation. This research project will investigate program analysis and transformation techniques to support the categorization, selection, and refactoring of code clones. The topic of clone detection has been investigated in the past by many researchers. However, scientific foundations to support analysis and automated transformation of the results reported from a clone detection tool are still lacking and often require a manual approach to clone refactoring. The key focus of this research is an investigation into the foundational analysis and transformation techniques that will provide a software engineer with the proper tool support to increase their productivity while improving the correctness of adaptive changes in the presence of clones. This project has potential for broad impact across many domains in critical application areas (e.g., scientific and ?e-science,? as well as middleware for enterprise software). In addition, contributions toward educational objectives are core to the proposed research plan.</Abstract>

<Abstract>SRS-0820208/0819845&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;TITLE: Scalable Knowledge-based Middleware For Networked And Mobile Systems&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI: Boon Thau Loo (University of Pennsylvania)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Co-PI: William C. Regli (Drexel University)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Senior Personnel: Joseph B. Kopena (Drexel University)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research investigates scalable, knowledge-based middleware supporting content-based addressing and routing in mobile, networked systems. It incorporates and integrates two aspects: Ontological reasoning about system resources and declarative networking within routing components. At the application layer is OntoNet, a knowledge-based framework for representing and reasoning on system elements. Declarative, formal techniques provide service discovery and composition, content-based messaging, and distributed querying using OWL-Net, a subset of the OWL description logic. This work includes development of propagation strategies that are efficient and robust in mobile, networked environments. Network layer support is provided by declarative networks, a rule-based framework for compact, high-level protocol specifications. Declarative networking enables rapid prototyping and verification as well as online adaptation and meta-reasoning. This research will include extension of declarative networking to more readily support highly dynamic mobile wireless systems. The intellectual merit of this proposal is development of a unified, declarative framework for distributed organization of knowledge and information in real-world systems. It draws from many areas such as the Semantic Web, databases, and networking. Potential broader impacts are richer and more extensible platforms for real-world networks usable in emergency response, logistics, infrastructure monitoring, and ubiquitous computing.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Software Engineering (34)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project focuses on developing the new skills needed of IT workers - skills in systems integration and evolution rather than system development, &amp;quot;services engineering&amp;quot; rather than the traditional &amp;quot;software engineering.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project involves: 1) Organizing this material into a curriculum that communicates both the problem context and the problem solving to undergraduates; 2) Creating a four-course track in services engineering that can be incorporated in any undergraduate Computer Science program; and 3) Establishing a process of continuous improvement though community-building activities. As part of this track development, a set of benchmark or reference enterprise applications is built that are representative of the complexity found in extant enterprise systems, and serve as an exemplar enterprise system for the curricular material, as well as the core on which laboratory assignments for the above courses are based. This curriculum is rigorously assessed and validated internally, and validated externally by offering this material through an equivalent set of three short courses to industry professionals, and getting their feedback.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual merit: The process of direct engagement with industry has resulted in knowledge creation relevant to the management of complex enterprise systems and services. This experiential knowledge combined with project assets is organized and integrated into a curriculum teachable to undergraduates that move into the workforce. In addition to the curriculum creation itself, also unique is the two-fold assessment process. Because this curriculum is intended to make better practitioners, it is offered (in addition to the classroom setting) directly to industry professionals, for their assessment and evaluation of the impact to their capabilities and their on-the-job performance.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impact: The immediate dissemination plan is to help incorporate this curriculum within partner institutions. The materials created also enable other institutions to create their own services engineering courses.</Abstract>

<Abstract>SNOWY is a collaborative project between Subarctic Indigenous communities in the Yukon River Basin (YRB) and scientists from Colorado State University (CSU), the US Geological Survey (USGS), the US Forest Service (USFS), and the grassroots, non-profit organization, the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (YRITWC) to combine qualitative and quantitative data on water quality and quantity of the Yukon River. Building upon the existing partnership and water-quality monitoring program between the USGS and the YRITWC, established in 2005 to measure the effects of climate change on the biogeochemistry of the Yukon River, SNOWY will provide a holistic view of how climate change is affecting Yukon River communities by exploring the social/cultural/economic/spiritual relationships of local people to the annual hydrologic cycle of the YRB. Utilizing community capacity that was developed as a key component of the water-quality monitoring project, SNOWY will collect snow and water data during the winter, complementing the existing summer data collection, and create a database that truly reflects the hydrology of the system. CSU and USGS scientists are working with community members through meetings, workshops, and interviews in order to a gain a more complete understanding of the social and environmental changes in the YRB in recent years. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A key component of the project is the &amp;quot;Healing Journey&amp;quot;, a field trip taken by scientists and community members to travel a portion of the Yukon River by dog sled and/or snowmachine in the winter months. YRITWC has conducted a number of summertime Healing Journeys in order to bring together community and scientific understandings of the YRB and the changes taking place. Previous Healing Journeys have been conducted in traditional open water transports, such as canoes. The YRITWC has found that arriving via traditional transport creates an instant rapport with local people who are then willing and interested to learn more about the science that accompanies the trip. By employing this same technique in the winter season the SNOWY?s 300-mile Healing Journey will begin at Russian Mission, travel to the mouth of the Yukon and end at the community of Chevak, a coastal community on a tributary of the Yukon River. Although many of the research questions and hypotheses have been developed, the SNOWY team anticipates that others will arise through community dialogs that will be facilitated during the project. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Yukon River communities were involved in the conceptualization of this project and will be directly involved in the research through training, data gathering, analysis, and the sharing and exchange of knowledge, both scientific and indigenous that will take place throughout the course of this project. Scientists and communities will be working together in order to push the boundaries of current epistemological and ontological thinking while creating real solutions to climate change impacts.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Cyber-ShARE (&amp;quot;Cyberinfrastructure for Sharing resources to Advance Research and Education&amp;quot;) Center of Excellence at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) was established in 2007 with a mission to advance education and research through cyberinfrastructures that support information exchange and integration, as well as collaborative interdisciplinary research. The Center conducts research and prepares a workforce that can tackle some of the most challenging problems confronting society. The interdisciplinary research at the Center has resulted in tools and approaches that support scholarly interdisciplinary collaboration by facilitating the ability to share knowledge, concepts, approaches, and perspectives. As national leaders in the study of collaborative science and engineering, the Center has developed and applied models of team-based, cooperative learning, interdisciplinary teamwork, and knowledge integration. Areas of advancement in cyberinfrastructure (CI) have been in data management, data analysis, and virtual organizations in support of collaboration. In particular, CI research has focused on scientists&amp;apos; ability to document data collection and product development in ways that enable sharing and reuse of scientific results by enhancing results with provenance and other critical information.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Center&amp;apos;s crosscutting expertise is in collaboration and collaborative environments, semantic-based approaches to knowledge synthesis and representation (ontologies and provenance), and propagation of uncertainty in integrated analyses. The subprojects through which this expertise will transcend are as follows:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) Knowledge Representation, Negotiation and Integration: Linking Human and Machine Knowledge Models through Semantics&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(2) Advancing Understanding of Ecosystem Processes Using Cyberinfrastructure&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(3) Integrated Analysis for Development of 3-D Models of Earth Structure&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Cyber-ShARE&amp;apos;s research in analysis of climate change impacts on the environment and the modeling of Earth&amp;apos;s structure has advanced through the Center&amp;apos;s interdisciplinary approaches supported by CI. Our environmental science group is advancing understanding of carbon flux in extreme desert and arctic environments through innovative multi-scale data collection and analysis, along with novel methods for minimizing error propagation and ensuring data quality. Our geophysics research group is developing more accurate models of the Rio Grande Rift System through computational approaches to data integration and model fusion. The Center has developed novel tools that allow researchers to more effectively analyze the large amounts of data being collected through environmental and seismic sensor networks in these projects and around our nation. Sensor data are critical for understanding short and long term global change, enabling better understanding of the effects of climate change on water and energy, and the effects of earth structure on earthquake risk. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In the next phase of funding, the Cyber-ShARE Center will continue to conduct innovative, synergistic STEM research supported by CI in the areas of environmental science and geosciences. Among a large number of research questions to be investigated as part of the three subprojects are the following: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;How can we create a machine understandable representation of individual mental models and integrated conceptual frameworks for interdisciplinary research, facilitated by advanced cyber-infrastructure?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;What factors control land-atmosphere exchange of carbon, water and energy in desert and arctic terrestrial ecosystems and over what spatial and time scales?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;How can Semantic Web technologies be used to enhance open access environmental data sharing, discovery, retrieval, integration, analysis, and visualization?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;What is the evolution of the Rio Grande Rift and how does this relate to other active rifts, for example, the East Africa Rift System?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Can scientists understand, believe and accept new insights in the tectonic evolution of the southwest (and other regions) that were produced through the development of CI and CI-based applications that can seamlessly integrate and optimally fuse existing information sources?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Center is critical to broadening training and education of interdisciplinary, CI-knowledgeable citizens, including STEM students who receive advanced degrees and represent the 21st century demographics. Compared to the national averages for graduate students in geology and environmental and computer science (NSF 2008), Cyber-ShARE students are 82.7% Hispanic while the national average is 4.7%, and 36.5% female while the national average is 30.8%. The Center aims to reach even higher levels of involvement of citizens from underrepresented groups during Phase II. The Center will extend the network of Cyber-ShARE collaborations to include other major CI projects, international collaborators, and industry partners.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Introduction&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research project is an ethnographic study of living organ transfer as a potent site where Americans grapple with challenges to fundamental Euro-American liberal assumptions about bodies and persons. It brings perspectives from studies of science and technology that are highly attentive to materiality and the shifting ontological status of objects.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In contrast to previous studies? disinterest in organs themselves, this research emphasizes sharing as a way to attend not only to the value of organs and tissues as they move and regenerate, but also to how their very materiality is enacted and circumscribed through particular configurations of knowledge, practices, and relationships. The fieldwork is thus driven by two interrelated objectives. The first is to explore when and how living organ transfer is understood through the analytic of sharing, staying equally attentive to situations in which sharing is not expressed, namely when &amp;quot;mine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;yours&amp;quot; are emphasized and understood as being mutually exclusive. The second is to explore the ways in which transplanted organs and transplant-modified bodies are rendered material and agentive in particular ways that shape and are shaped by attitudes toward organ ownership.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Potential Broader Impacts&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Drawing on the experiences of enduring connectivity between living organ donors and recipients, the research proposes to revitalize sharing as an analytical concept. Elaborating this long ignored mode of possession promises to enrich ways of talking about property, exchange, and relationships by providing a term that emphasizes connection without assuming this connection to be necessarily founded in sameness, equality, or joy. The focus on sharing also stands to help living organ donors, recipients, and other interested parties give valid expression to experiences that contradict the &amp;quot;spare parts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gift of life&amp;quot; models that currently dominate transplant rhetoric.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Three primary tissues present in early embryos, endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm, ultimately develop into all body parts of vertebrates. Shortly after initial mesoderm is established, two distinct populations of mesoderm separate, providing the cells for axial and appendicular mesodermal tissues. Extensive integration occurs between cells within these two forms of mesoderm to ensure that the musculoskeletal system forms correctly. Despite recent advances in knowledge of the genetics of muscle and bone formation in the limbs and the vertebral axis, how integration of the axial and appendicular mesodermal tissues is regulated is still largely unknown. The research proposed here focuses on the changes that occur at the mesodermal boundary between axial and appendicular systems where musculoskeletal integration is achieved. The proposal focuses on the pectoral region where formation of the forelimb is functionally linked to the axial system. The interface between somitic and lateral plate mesoderm is called the lateral somitic frontier. It is proposed that genetic patterning information is regulated independently in distinct mesodermal domains, distinguishing the two domains as evolutionarily conserved modules in developmental. Transgenic mice will be used to eliminate specific patterning genes in these distinct mesodermal domains independently. Transplant surgeries in amphibian embryos will map the frontier in amphibians to determine the evolutionary basal state for the tetrapod lineage. This research will have broad impact on the developmental biology community by providing detailed embryonic context in which to study the function of molecular factors involved in patterning the mesoderm. The data generated will be used in collaboration to build, test, and increase the power of new biological ontologies now under construction (e.g. AmphibAnat) and be available to the greater community. This work will also provide broad based training experiences for undergraduate and graduate students including hands on experience in embryology, molecular biology, and computer assisted 3D modeling.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The IASOA web and data portal have been recognized as a key and evolving deliverable of the IASOA planning process. The &amp;quot;Data-at-a-Glance&amp;quot; portal, in particular, adds value above isolated efforts through acting as a single cross-site gateway to all shared IASOA data. There are currently over 180 links of this type in the &amp;quot;Data-at-a-Glance&amp;quot; portal of the website, with varying degrees of functionality, and limited standard metadata. Potentially transformative insights into long-term and pan-Arctic atmospheric trends reside in this archive waiting to be harvested. In response to the high priority placed on the IASOA web and data portal by the steering committee, and in recognition of the value of interoperable metadata standards for broader data harvesting and use, the PI will conduct a pilot project to enhance the IASOA data portal through application of shared ontologies, coordination with other Arctic atmospheric data archives, standardization of metadata, and outreach to user communities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will support a team of investigators who seek to resolve evolutionary relationships within the fungi. The research will enhance understanding of the ancient evolutionary diversification of the fungi by addressing evolutionary relationships among the major groups of fungi. This study will develop integrated molecular and morphological datasets, which will be freely accessible on the Web. Molecular data will include sequences from a target set of 76 genes that were identified from analyses of known fungal genomes. Morphological data will include characters associated with nuclear and cellular division and the morphological organization of hyphae. In addition the study will develop ontologies for morphological characters to promote further sampling and analytical integration across disparate organisms. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Fungi make up one of the major groups of life, with an estimated diversity of approximately 1.5 million species. These organisms play crucial ecological roles as decomposers, beneficial mutualists, and parasites and pathogens, including pathogens of humans. The economic significance of fungi is almost incalculable as they perform essential ecological functions and impact diverse applied disciplines, including agriculture, medicine, and drug discovery. A better understanding of the early evolutionary history of the Fungi is necessary to expand our knowledge of the history of life of Earth and the evolution of its ecosystems. Phylogenomic analyses and databases for fungi will transform the field of comparative fungal biology and will benefit all fields of fungal biology that rely on an accurate understanding of evolutionary relationships and diversity of Fungi. The bioinformatics tools for managing and analyzing phylogenomic data that will be developed will be broadly applicable across the Tree of Life. Training and outreach activities will include graduate and post-doctoral training, undergraduate training, and outreach to K-12 educators.</Abstract>

<Abstract>There is an urgent need for models of financial ecosystems that are driven and informed by data. Unfortunately, current financial cyberinfrastructures severely restrict the availability of data to market participants, regulators and researchers. There are constraints on the data collection authority of regulators that are exacerbated by the lack of ontologies and standards. Beyond these limitations is the inherent challenge of dealing with the complexity of financial information and meeting the diverse and sophisticated analyses required to model heterogeneous ecosystems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For computer scientists to get engaged, a central requirement is the availability of data -- as exemplar and for testing and benchmarking. While some types of data are easily available, many other important types of financial data are proprietary and generally unavailable to the computing research community. The creation of a community infrastructure can go a long way toward meeting this need and hence enabling computer science research in a new domain of data science for finance.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The impact of the next generation of community financial cyberinfrastructure and a framework of data science for finance will be significant. There will be increasing synergy from applying computational technology, BIGDATA and Linked Data, and social media, to address difficult modeling and monitoring problems. This may result in improved tools for regulators, as well as fundamentally new designs of market mechanisms, recommendations, ratings, etc. On the educational frontier, data science for finance should nurture a new generation of multi-disciplinary scholars who will blend computational solutions with theories, models and methodologies from finance, economics, mathematics and statistics.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Semantic Provenance Capture in Data Ingest Systems (SPCDIS)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In analyzing the needs of instrument data providers, several challenges are&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;clear:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Data is coming in faster, in greater volumes and outstripping our ability to perform adequate quality control.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Data is being used in new ways and we frequently do not have sufficient information on what happened to the data along the processing stages to determine if it is suitable for a use we did not envision.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- We often fail to capture, represent and propagate manually generated information that need to go with the data flows.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Each time we develop a new instrument, we develop a new data ingest procedure and collect different metadata and organize it differently. It is then hard to use with previous projects.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- The task of event determination and feature classification is onerous and we don&amp;apos;t do it until after we get the data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These statements point to the lack of a comprehensive, re-useable data ingest framework that consists of a semantically rich set of annotations along the data ingest workflow and a smart storage, propagation and retrieval mechanism for the provenance and derivation information. For the purpose of this project, provenance is defined as: the origin or source from which something comes, its intention for use, who/what is was generated for, its manner, sense of place, and time of manufacture, production or discovery, history of subsequent owners, and documented in detail sufficient to allow reproducibility. Thus, the goal of this project is to provide an extensible representation for provenance for data ingest systems. Initially, we limit our focus to the set of solar coronal physics instruments operated at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory in Hawaii by the High Altitude Observatory, National Center for Atmospheric Research. Over time, we will target the broader area of solar and solar-terrestrial physics, including the proposed Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory. This project leverages innovative work with the Inference Web explanation framework which provides a set of tools for generating, validating, manipulating, summarizing, and presenting knowledge provenance. In addition we will utilize its Interlingua for provenance, justification, and trust representation - PML - the Proof Markup Language.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Two important concepts to be captured are the data quality and nature of the processing stages that the data has passed through. Both qualitative and quantitative encodings of data quality are very important to a scientist determining if the data of interest are useful, applicable or accurate enough for the intended use.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The provenance work will have broad applicibility since it will include domain-independent portions geared for any data ingest system as well as a domain-literate module aimed at solar and solar-terrestrial physics. This project is expected to generate a science-driven extension to PML that will provide representational primitives required for scientific provenance. The project will also contribute to community standards by adding meta data to ontologies developed in related projects with a wide degree of applicability to similar community and government programs.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Semantic Provenance Capture in Data Ingest Systems (SPCDIS)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In analyzing the needs of instrument data providers, several challenges are&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;clear:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Data is coming in faster, in greater volumes and outstripping our ability to perform adequate quality control.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Data is being used in new ways and we frequently do not have sufficient information on what happened to the data along the processing stages to determine if it is suitable for a use we did not envision.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- We often fail to capture, represent and propagate manually generated information that need to go with the data flows.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- Each time we develop a new instrument, we develop a new data ingest procedure and collect different metadata and organize it differently. It is then hard to use with previous projects.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- The task of event determination and feature classification is onerous and we don&amp;apos;t do it until after we get the data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These statements point to the lack of a comprehensive, re-useable data ingest framework that consists of a semantically rich set of annotations along the data ingest workflow and a smart storage, propagation and retrieval mechanism for the provenance and derivation information. For the purpose of this project, provenance is defined as: the origin or source from which something comes, its intention for use, who/what is was generated for, its manner, sense of place, and time of manufacture, production or discovery, history of subsequent owners, and documented in detail sufficient to allow reproducibility. Thus, the goal of this project is to provide an extensible representation for provenance for data ingest systems. Initially, we limit our focus to the set of solar coronal physics instruments operated at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory in Hawaii by the High Altitude Observatory, National Center for Atmospheric Research. Over time, we will target the broader area of solar and solar-terrestrial physics, including the proposed Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory. This project leverages innovative work with the Inference Web explanation framework which provides a set of tools for generating, validating, manipulating, summarizing, and presenting knowledge provenance. In addition we will utilize its Interlingua for provenance, justification, and trust representation - PML - the Proof Markup Language.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Two important concepts to be captured are the data quality and nature of the processing stages that the data has passed through. Both qualitative and quantitative encodings of data quality are very important to a scientist determining if the data of interest are useful, applicable or accurate enough for the intended use.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The provenance work will have broad applicibility since it will include domain-independent portions geared for any data ingest system as well as a domain-literate module aimed at solar and solar-terrestrial physics. This project is expected to generate a science-driven extension to PML that will provide representational primitives required for scientific provenance. The project will also contribute to community standards by adding meta data to ontologies developed in related projects with a wide degree of applicability to similar community and government programs.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project supports ethnographic field research of a graduate student, Josh Wisniewski, in an Inupiaq subsistence hunting community in Northwest, Alaska. In the tradition of ethnographic anthropology, Wisniewski will explore the relationship between Inupiaq knowledge of the environment and active immersion in the environment. Through participant observation and semi structured interviews, the researcher will collect data on the ecological/economic and the ideological/cosmologic dimensions of human action in the arctic. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Working as an apprentice hunter, Wisniewski will explore his hypothesis that local ways of knowing the environment extend beyond taxonomic descriptions, animal behavior, and migration routes. Local modes of knowing and engaging in a &amp;quot;sentient&amp;quot; natural world form a relational ontological framework. Through this project, the researcher hopes to gain insight into this knowledge framework and a deeper understanding of Inupiaq personhood. In addition, because this community may be forced to relocate due to climate induced erosion destabilizing their shore, the project will contribute to the community&amp;apos;s on-going cultural and historic preservation by providing textual and visual media materials documenting ecological knowledge, hunting and food preservation practices, as well as insights into adaptation to their rapidly changing environment.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Just as energy was a dominant factor for activity and change in the twentieth century, so information and infrastructure appear as change agents of the twenty-first century along with the participant roles associated with them. Growing interdisciplinary practices and changing work roles influence data and information delivery in a range of organizational scenarios from the research institution to a project community such as the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network. A growing understanding of the influence of sociotechnical factors prompts this project&amp;apos;s response to the challenges of understanding the interdependencies of information and infrastructure in support of science. The field of information science in all its varied forms (bioinformatics, ecoinformatics, social informatics, ocean informatics, organizational informatics) addresses questions of data management, organizational scaling, and interdisciplinary bridging relevant to infrastructure design. The Palmer LTER Antarctic marine site research team with information management embedded within local institutions as well as within the LTER community provides a unique opportunity to begin thinking broadly about questions of &amp;apos;how to infrastructure&amp;apos;. This project addresses the issue of establishing cross discipline communications and fulfilling the NSF cyberinfrastructure goals that call for social scientists working constructively with scientists and technologists. The aim of this project is contribute findings to ongoing dialogues about sociotechnical issues within the partnered communities. This proposal addresses infrastructure design by broadening the technical research perspective in collaboration with ongoing research programs at multiple levels. The approach integrates a theoretical exploration of interdisciplinary grounded in ethnographic analysis with developing procedures for formative evaluations of cyberinfrastructure development using ethnographic methods developed in the Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Participatory Design communities. Conceptual frameworks will broaden to include assessment issues as they are developing within social informatics and scientific collaboratory research today. This work will enrich the development of Palmer LTER information management design strategies with respect to metadata and databases as well as the associated education outreach programs. In terms of broader impacts, this collaborative effort serves as a unique bridge for information science, social science, and ocean science in support of scientific research over the long-term. There is growing work on understanding failed information system deployments and in expanding technology interface dialogues beyond the computer supported cooperative work applied within the medical and business domains. Given trends toward automation and integration within the scientific arena with the recent focus on building scientific ontologies and interoperable systems, this proposal considers both existing and new work practices as well as works to identify and articulate transition mechanisms pertinent across multiple fields. Research into sociotechnical issues is critical today given the scientific trends to scale up infrastructure, information systems, and scientific partnerships.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This is the first year of funding of a 4 year, continuing award. One of the major roadblocks in the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;efficient and accurate communication between humans and machines is the resolution of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ambiguity inherent in natural languages. A major bottleneck in developing solutions is the severe&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;shortage of training data that distinguishes word senses, and the high cost of inputting this&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;information manually. A focus of this project is the development of unsupervised and minimally&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;supervised algorithms for acquiring such skills without costly hand-tagged training data. Such&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;methods will exploit the distribution properties observed in very large text corpora (over 10 billion&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;words); the PI will also investigate richer representations of feature space, class models,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;smoothing methods and learning algorithms specialized for classification in very high-dimensional&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;featurespaces. In addition to the problem of word-sense disambiguation, this project will explore&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;shared solutions to a closely related set of lexical-ambiguity tasks including spelling correction,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;propername classification, capitalization restoration, accent and diacritic restoration for, diverse&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;languages, vowel restoration in Hebrew and Arabic, speech synthesis on homographs, lexical&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;choice in machine translation, and certain aspects of choosing among phonetically confusable&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;candidates in speech recognition. These diverse problems are not normally recognized as being&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;members of the same class, and this project seeks to exploit the synergies present by developing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;methods and training data on one member of the class and utilizing the methods and data on other.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;problems in the class. Thus this unified approach offers the potential for rapid parallel progress on&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;key problems in human-computer interaction and information extraction.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Through examining the ways that values are enmeshed in three scientific research programs related to psychiatry, this project merges two significant strands of recent intellectual history: contemporary philosophy and sociology of science, which tell us that values have an influential role in shaping science; and social critiques of psychiatry, which are prompting reevaluation of psychiatric understanding and treatment of mentally disordered people. The project aims to analyze and specify the particular manifestations of values within the three programs. It hypothesizes that significant conflicts will be found between scientific, professional, and social values. These conflicts may partly determine the results of the research program. The research areas are psychiatric genetics, psychopathological personality theory, and psychopharmacology. The project will assemble the relevant scientific, professional and lay literatures for each focus. The analyses will focus on specific research questions and scientific controversies within each of the three areas. The project uses a descriptive-causal model to identify and differentiate values in scientific discourse. Values are defined as descriptions or conditions that both guide human action and lead the actor to be susceptible to praise or blame. The model&amp;apos;s classification scheme is used to identify the various ways that values appear in written discourses and address a variety of value-related questions such as: What roles do values play in the comparison of competing theories within a scientific controversy? What ontological assumptions are involved in the various theoretical and research focuses, and how does the research privilege these assumptions? What role do practical, professional and social interests play in shaping the research program and its findings? What are the ethical implications of the research? A philosophy of science consultant and scientist-consultants in each of the three areas will aid in collection and interpretation of the respective literatures, and results of these analyses will be published in professional and humanities journals.</Abstract>

Recent developments in medical technology have brought closer the possibility of direct control of a computer by the human brain, e.g. using recordings from electrodes placed on the scalp or a neurotrophic electrode that is implanted in the brain. Although advances in these biometric interface device technologies hold much promise, there are many aspects yet to be researched. For the half-million people with locked-in syndrome (completely paralyzed and unable to speak), and for many others with severe and progressive disabilities such as quadriplegia or ALS, the potential impact of BCI technology are staggering; preliminary results achieved by the PI encourage vigorous pursuit of refinements and improvements in BCI technology. In this project the PI&amp;apos;s objectives will be: to establish a theoretical framework for the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research; to investigate the effectiveness of various user interaction styles for existing brain-computer interface device technologies; and to validate various interaction styles in two quality-of-life application domains, a basic communications application and an environmental control application.</Abstract>

<Abstract>1224638&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Horsburgh&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This EAR Geoinformatics Program grant supports a two year project to develop a community information model and related software to enable web based interoperability of earth observations derived from sensors and samples that span now discrete data and informatics initiatives for multiple communities. The system would target specific existing web service data repositories in order to demonstrate how the information model can support federation of earth observations data across multiple data publication systems. Specific repositories include the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS), EarthChem, the Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) Integrated Data Management System (CZOData), the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and the Data Observations Network for Earth (DataONE). The plan calls for collaboration with the related Pis of these projects (through subward support) to improve capture, sharing, and archival these data and associated metadata by building ontologies for describing, encoding and publishing data in common formats to allow interoperability. The plan involves community workshops to engage stakeholders and students in the design of the model. The model would incorporate international standards for data description and publishing utilizing Open Geospataial Consortium standards and domain specific markup languages. It is hoped that the results will feed directly into the larger EarthCube cyberinfrastructure initiative. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;***</Abstract>

<Abstract>Biodiversity comprises all variations of life at all levels of biological organization, most of which arise from genomic diversity. As genomic technologies become available across the biological sciences, a full characterization of biodiversity demands a full characterization of genomes. Similarly, data synthesis across the full range of biodiversity research domains demands development, implementation, integration and harmonization of data exchange standards. Such interoperable informatics would be transformational for our understanding of biology, with consequent impact on environmental and conservation policy. Adding to the transformational potential is the fact that the microbial world represents half of the world&amp;apos;s biomass and nearly all of its biodiversity, yet is still effectively invisible and intractable to traditional biodiversity research. Metagenomic data are not amenable to the concepts, standards, semantics, and methods of traditional eukaryotic biodiversity, and therefore, require an alternate informatics framework.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The EAGER will transform the collaborations between two previously separate research communities: the informaticists of the traditional biodiversity community, who employ the Darwin Core (DwC) as a standard, and the informaticists of the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC), who have developed the Minimal Information about any Sequence (MIxS) standard for genomics, metagenomics and marker genes. Together, these groups will engage in a unified informatics effort to develop three layers of interoperability. The EAGER will harmonize the observational (DwC) and genomic (MIxS) standards, building on a community dialogue and interdisciplinary networking hosted and established under an NSF Research Coordination Network. Standards interoperability is the basis for the next two layers. Syntactic interoperability (in the context of Internet APIs and a database Reference Model) will be supported. The EAGER will assemble experts from the two communities to (a) devise a database Reference Model that integrates the DwC and GSC MIxS standards; and (b) for effective data management, create specific implementations for different database platforms to foster adoption. The practical implementation of the reference model on/for different database systems will allow, for the first time, systematic comparative testing of technical performance and of use cases (e.g., which implementation best serves which complex data query). The EAGER will create task groups to establish the infrastructure for managing ontologies, and to construct a reference model on the purely semantic level in order to fuse the two worlds of data standards, both of which are advanced enough to engage in useful interoperability.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In developing an interdisciplinary information infrastructure to achieve data interoperability across domains, this EAGER would advance understanding of complex environmental phenomena and, thereby, inform future policy decisions. Indeed, by leading to an informatics standards platform to conceive a novel conceptual and theoretical framework for the world of microbial ?dark matter,? the EAGER would have a transformational impact beyond science.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Eleodes is a flightless genus of darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) endemic to western North America. Commonly called stink beetles, Eleodes are known for their &amp;quot;headstanding&amp;quot; behavior and the noxious chemicals they eject when threatened. This project will open the genus to other disciplines by addressing century-old systematic challenges through a comprehensive phylogenetic research strategy and an innovative, content management system-based data accumulation approach. It will create a virtual specimen-based knowledge environment for Eleodes taxonomy, morphology, and natural history linking specimens, images, and reference works to associated taxonomic, phylogenetic, ontologically annotated anatomical and geographic data. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will strongly advance our understanding of Eleodes and tenebrionid systematics through focused training of a postdoctoral scholar, a Ph.D. student, and minimally 8-12 undergraduate students. Virtually all data generated will be available through the project web portal and secondarily uploaded to EOL and Morphbank. The scientific community and general public will be engaged through a synergistic extension of Eleodes specimen data and images to the &amp;quot;Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network&amp;quot; (SCAN), the creation of a biodiversity informatics lab module, and by incorporating Eleodes biology and diversity themes into ASU&amp;apos;s outreach program, including the development of learning applications and implementation of school and museum activities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research is motivated by the problem of spinal cord injuries, with the goal of producing data that can lead to pharmacological or other interventions to make recovery possible. It is hypothesized that major changes after a spinal cord injury occur on the protein level, and that a model of protein changes and interactions between proteins will make it possible to elucidate previously unnoticed relationships between the participating proteins and protein pathways. To do this, a computational neuroscience approach is a necessary addition to laboratory experiments. This analysis requires a considerable amount of background knowledge; to acquire this knowledge, natural language processing (text mining) is necessary; specifically, new techniques for natural language processing need to be developed in the neuroscience domain.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research plan involves a series of proteomics experiments to be carried out on rats with induced spinal cord injuries and the interpretation of these results using a computational systems biology approach. The quality of knowledge-based computational analysis depends critically on the breadth of formally represented knowledge in the program. A major challenge is that much of the requisite knowledge is &amp;quot;buried&amp;quot; in scientific publications, rather than being available in computable form in databases. Therefore, novel text mining techniques will be developed, tailored for the neuroscience domain, to extract such knowledge from scientific publications and convert it into a computable form. A generic computational analytical tool, known as Hanalyzer, is already available but needs to be adapted to the specific problem; the challenge is to develop the natural language processing technology. A neuroscience-specific aspect of this challenge is that there is a high diversity in the surface forms of words that are used to refer to spinal cord regeneration, making machine-learning-based approaches susceptible to data sparsity and rule-based approaches vulnerable to an intractable number of keywords that must be accounted for. A distributional approach will be used to approach this challenge, with novel techniques that make use of semantic role labeling, recognition of ontological concepts, and dependency parsing to learn the surface forms that correspond to abstract or implicit concepts like spinal cord regeneration.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is a collaboration involving investigators in Denver, Colorado and in Duesseldorf, Germany. A companion project is being funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).</Abstract>

<Abstract>Interdisciplinary (99) This project is designing, deploying, and evaluating software tools that automatically structure and scaffold undergraduate student interactions within online discussion boards. Based on analysis of archived student contributions to previous discussion topics the software tools recommend those contributions that are useful, relevant or of interest to undergraduates currently participating in discussions of the same topic. Rich assessment techniques are being developed to analyze discussions, and these are based on course ontologies and course corpora that the PI team is creating. Tutorial strategies used include generation of questions and comments, invitations to participate in discussions, and clarifying annotations. Furthermore, student profiles of interest or expertise help link individual students to one another on particular topics. Evaluation studies focus on the effects of different scaffolding interventions on student performance, STEM interest, and retention rates. The intellectual merit of the project lies in two areas: 1) the assessment of how the collaboration and reflection features impact STEM undergraduate student performance and student interest in science and engineering; and 2) the development of innovative technologies for automatic scaffolding and assessment of student contributions. The project&amp;apos;s potential for broader impacts derives from its support for peer learning, reflection, and collaborative problem solving. These attributes increase student engagement and performance and can deepen conceptual understanding across a wide range and number of students in classroom settings that are not constrained by enrollment, since they are web delivered.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Evidence chaining and &amp;quot;dipping&amp;quot; are powerful analytical paradigms to explore entities and their connections in semantically rich, multi-source databases. Starting from a small set of seeds such as known suspects or the result of some exploratory query, an analyst can draw from various data sources to explore the space of entities connected to these seeds via any number of relations. However, since there are often many relations, facts, attributes and transactions associated with each entity, they can be richly interconnected which can quickly lead to very large numbers of objects linked to the initial seeds.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Relationship simplification is one approach to reduce this space effectively and provide a more abstract view for analysts by (1) reducing the number of different relations through abstraction and normalization, and (2) focusing on strongly and relevantly connected objects by computing a measure of connection strength or relevance. To address (1) we propose to use knowledge representation and reasoning (KR&amp;amp;R) technology, which allows us to represent evidence at very high fidelity, utilize sophisticated ontologies and domain theories, have a natural means to represent abstraction and meta-knowledge, map easily between different representations and exploit powerful inference procedures to make implicit relationships explicit. To address (2) we need to consolidate and aggregate all relations between two objects, statistically contrast them with connections to and among other entities and compute a measure of closeness or interestingness to filter out irrelevant or uninteresting objects and connections. To dynamically compute connection strength, we propose to use an information theoretical model to determine the weight of each relation as well as to take the context of a relationship into account. This will allow us to aggregate all relations between objects and measure closeness between them to simplify a large data space and compress it into a more abstract, simplified view.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We will integrate the Relationship Simplifier with the BLACKBOOK system for uniform access to data and results and communication with other components. In addition, our components can also access relational data directly from one or more relational databases which is useful when dealing with very large datasets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Dr. Rouse is tracing the emergence of new images of science and new ways of conceptualizing and investigating scientific knowledge from criticism of philosophical and sociological disputes over realism and the rationality of science. These disputes typically presume a conception of scientific knowledge as a body of representations whose content and relation to the world must be explained, whether by reasons and evidence &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; to science, or &amp;quot;external&amp;quot; social and practical embodiment of scientific knowledge and its temporal dynamics. Dr. Rouse believes that these disputes oversimplify and distort the political and cultural significance of the sciences in their attempt to vindicate or challenge the legitimacy of the scientific enterprise. Dr. Rouse is attempting to develop a more adequate account of these aspects of the sciences, using his account to criticize directly the concepts of the &amp;quot;content&amp;quot; of scientific knowledge and the &amp;quot;ontological status&amp;quot; of its objects which are at issue in the rationality and realism disputes. He aims to show how the positions in these disputes derive their apparent significance from their place within what he sees as problematic cultural conflicts over the &amp;quot;legitimacy of the modern age.&amp;quot;</Abstract>

<Abstract>This workshop proposal addresses data management research for the semantic web. Semantic web is mainly about technology for machine understandable and machine readable web pages. To date, much of the research on the semantic web has focussed on developing ontologies and languages such as the Resource Description Framework. There is a lot of research that needs to be done on querying and indexing the web pages. The participants of this workshop will be those who are actively conducting research in data management and the semantic web from academia and industrial research laboratories. The workshop will include short presentations by the experts as well as extensive discussions on research directions and challenges. The outcome of this workshop will be a list of recommendations for further research on data management support for the semantic web.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of the proposed project is to extend the science and reading comprehension intervention known as Science IDEAS to larger scales. The intervention combines science inquiry with reading comprehension and writing activities in two-hour daily time blocks in grades 3 through 8. The proposed project would expand the program to almost 40,000 students and would study the implementation and its effects. To help to insure its effectiveness, the project also provides the necessary infrastructure of leadership training, mentorship, and coaching. The proposal thereby addresses capacity issues in schools as mitigating the success of interventions and perpetuating deficiencies in students&amp;apos; science and reading achievement. A twofold research design is proposed, involving a school-level randomized experiment and a multiple baseline study of intervention efficacy in terms of maintaining previously attained student performance outcomes of the intervention during its scale up. Investigators anticipate advancing the process of educational reform through this research by validating and disseminating a multi-phase design for scale up.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal presents a visual approach to the representation and validation of document structures specified in XML and transformation of one structure to another, in a general framework of automatic language generation. The underlying theory of this visual approach is a context-sensitive graph grammar formalism. The proposal demonstrates the conciseness and expressiveness of the graph grammar formalism and its suitability to visual specification and automatic generation of visual XML languages. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The PI&amp;apos;s previous research on the graph grammar formalism and visual language generation will be extended and adapted to suit automatic generation of visual XML design languages with tools that assist the design of XML-like of documents and their translations between each other. A set of tools will be developed to facilitate the visual specification of XML-like document structures and automatic generation of target documents. The tools would therefore enable a wide community to use the latest computing and Internet technology in storing and exchanging digital documents. The tools and the concepts associated with them will also make excellent teaching and self-training vehicles for the courses on programming languages, compilers, and visual interfaces.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A collaborative award has been made to the University of Arizona and the University of California at Davis to develop novel ways of tying scientific names directly to published biological characteristics of organisms, and to implement a new user-friendly program, the Explorer of Taxon Concepts (ETC), to assist with the disambiguation of the scientific names of species at all taxonomic ranks. Prototypes from several successful NSF-funded projects are integrated through ETC to enable: (i) text-mining extraction of taxonomic knowledge from scientific literature, (ii) analysis and integration of this knowledge using logic-based reasoning and information theoretic methods, and (iii) result visualization. The results shed light on similarities and differences among various scientists&amp;apos; understanding of a particular species, as well as relations between the terminology used by different scientists, allowing for more accurate integration of data gathered by different investigators. A component of the ETC project is computer science research aimed at a novel integration of state-of-the-art logic inference and information theoretic approaches to taxonomic science.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Scientific names are the primary identifiers for organisms and the anchor for the communication and comparison of biological knowledge. However, there is constant revision of the definition of taxa by experts, making interpretation of the names through time challenging. This project will produce and demonstrate the use of ETC software on descriptive scientific literature from the Rosaceae (the Rose family) and Apoidea (the Bee super-family) to facilitate research into critical pollination systems. These pollination systems are currently of great concern due to reductions in bee populations globally with the potential to reduce yield of many staple food crops. ETC&amp;apos;s components support scientific knowledge value added to its inputs, making them useful in many other biodiversity information applications. Character and anatomy ontologies built and enhanced by the ETC project will benefit all knowledge-based applications in biology. The project adopts the following strategies to broaden its accessibility: The integration of ETC components with existing biological computing infrastructure such as DataONE and iPlant will make the tools broadly available. The partnership with iPlant&amp;apos;s successful Education, Outreach, and Training (EOT) group will document the software for instructional use and encourage its adoption in the classroom. Components of the research and the final products will also be packaged into learning modules for college and graduate level courses at University of Arizona, the University of California at Davis, and other universities.

<Abstract>The research objective of this award is to characterize the design cognition (design thinking) of professional engineering designers and to compare their design cognition with that of student engineers designing. Previous NSF-funded projects that involved studying engineers designing have primarily focused on studying students designing. There is a paucity of research on studying professional engineers designing. The science of engineering design requires empirical results not just from students but also from professionals. The empirical research method used to gain access to engineers design cognition is protocol analysis. This project uses a design-based ontological coding scheme to derive information from protocol studies of professional engineers designing. This coding scheme provides the foundation for describing the design cognition of designers and converts the qualitative data in a video of a designer into quantitative data from which statistical models of design behavior can be generated. These models characterize the design cognition of the designers. They are then used to compare the design cognition of professional engineers with that of students, whose design cognition was characterized in a previous NSF-funded study. Deliverable include an archive of protocol videos, a set of protocol transcripts, and a set of research methodologies as well as the statistical models.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, this research will characterize the design behavior of professional engineers. This will then be compared with the behavior predicted by formal models of designing. The results of this research are intended to provide the basis for determining similarities and differences between the design behavior of professional engineers and undergraduate engineers. The results will be disseminated to allow for improvement in design education to bring students to closer to professional engineers during their undergraduate and graduate design education. The results are intended to lay the foundation for the generation of design support tools.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will investigate a new generation of provenance-rich social knowledge collection systems that will greatly improve the ability of people to create online communities of interest and share information. The research will transform the state of the art in social content collection in several important ways. First, social knowledge collection systems will be augmented to support contributors to structure factual content, so that information can be aggregated to answer reasonably interesting albeit simple factual queries. We will build on a semantic wiki framework to allow users to create structured factual content as object-property-value triples. It will not assume pre-defined ontologies, but rather develop algorithms that analyze current content and suggest opportunities for structuring contributions so they can be aggregated to answer simple queries. Second, they will include detailed provenance records that reflect how the content was created, allowing contributors to enter alternative viewpoints and enabling consumers to make quality and trust judgments. The research will include developing algorithms that derive trust metrics from the provenance records, and to allow users to define views on the content based on provenance criteria. It will create novel approaches to propagate trust across content topics and categories and complement existing algorithms that propagate trust in social networks. Third, the systems will proactively guide contributors to invest effort where it is most needed, developing novel algorithms to detect knowledge gaps, and by allowing users to define queries that will be used to drive further contributions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This work has the potential for a broader impact in many areas where social content collection is already widely used, not only in scientific communities but also for societal issues, such as citizen participation in local communities, health, and governance. All these communities would benefit from further structure, provenance models, and guided knowledge collection. Despite their popularity, social content collection sites currently have important limitations. First, because the content has very little structure they cannot aggregate information and answer many simple questions. Second, contributors have uneven expertise and skills and therefore the content is of very varying quality, yet there is no assistance for consumers to tell apart the valuable from the dubious. Third, these sites depend on the initiative of contributors to figure out how the content needs to grow, and there is no systematic analysis to expose knowledge gaps and guide contributors proactively. This research project addresses all three of those issues.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Akin to a complex engineered system, biological processes operate through many simultaneous interactions within complex networks. Traditionally, biologists have constructed &amp;quot;models&amp;quot; to capture this complexity and verify their intuitions as well as communicate how a particular biological system or subsystem actually works. To build these models, biologists rely on a very general and broad array of knowledge, and also augment it with depth and expertise obtained from small number of exemplar systems. With availability of large amount of high-throughput experimental data, biologists are also faced with the task of reconstructing models from data where relevant information may be deeply buried in layers of numerical information.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Biological models are often presented pictorially as graphs and flow charts with many components, each corresponding to a certain biochemical reaction. Such diagrams have also, but not always, been associated with mathematical models, mostly in the form of differential equations. The equations are used to perform simulations of the system, when they have a well-defined set of kinetic parameters. The model is refuted or validated depending on whether the simulated traces agree with biological data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Often one is faced with situations, where there is no mathematical model, or the model is incomplete and they lack a complete set of parameters, and yet biologists do have detailed descriptive understanding of many of the components and their interactions. For instance, current microarray data analysis techniques draw the biologist&amp;apos;s attention to targeted sets of genes but do not otherwise present global and dynamic perspectives (e.g., invariants) inferred collectively over a dataset. When ontologically invariants are inferred from experiments (using GOALIE redescription tool), such invariants can be compared with the known descriptive information to determine if we have complete and consistent theories about certain biological processes.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project addresses these two scenarios by providing automated reasoning tools that bridge both computational and descriptive models in biology. The results from these tools and experimental analyses hint at the construction of efficiently testable predictions. The results of wet-lab experiments are then used to refine and amend the formal model. This feedback cycle between modeling and experimentation has proven important in obtaining a process-level understanding of the underlying cellular machinery.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The further characterization of specific parts of the mammalian cell cycle behavior (e.g. how a possibly unknown factor may allow the phosphorlyzation Cdk inhibitor p27 by Cdk2 at G1/S.)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In the longer run, understanding the wider implications of the complex regulatory and metabolic architecture of the cell cycle will provide significant insights into new applications of biology and advanced computing. In addition, they will provide new perspectives on computing by exploiting biologically driven metaphors. More importantly, the approaches developed in the context of hybrid-system (HS) models and bio-ontology will find applications to swarm robotics, social-software, e-commerce, complex interactive engineered systems, computer-security, adaptive software, etc., although from our own historical perspective, we will remain engaged in proving the first successes of this approach in biomedical applications.</Abstract>

<Abstract>There is a rich research literature on information integration (e.g., on data fusion, data integration, and data exchange, including schema matching, mapping, and composition), knowledge-representation, ontologies, and semantic web technologies. However, there has been little prior work on the related problem of merging annotated datasets that already have largely compatible schemas, but where data values of some fields can come from (or link to) different concept hierarchies (taxonomies). Combining datasets into a single, consistent representation is a prerequisite for addressing many important scientific questions (e.g. those that rely on data to be expressed at broad spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales). In practice, scientists combine multiple datasets manually, a time-intensive and error-prone process. In many application domains (e.g., biodiversity, ecology, systematics) data are often annotated with concepts from different but interrelated taxonomies. For instance, scientists who wish to combine datasets that record the presence or absence of species at given locations are often faced with datasets that draw species names from different taxonomies. In such cases, merging datasets requires aligning the different taxonomies. However, even for aligned taxonomies (i.e., where formal articulation constraints are given), many different dataset merges are possible, including inconsistent or incomplete ones. These in turn can yield different or even contradictory outcomes in subsequent interpretations and downstream data analysis. The primary goals of this project are to develop new techniques at the interface of data integration, knowledge-representation, and reasoning, to empower scientists by giving them new tools for merging and &amp;apos;logically debugging&amp;apos; taxonomies and annotated datasets. The proposed Euler toolkit will include a formal framework with a broad range of constraints and data types; novel provenance-based techniques to detect, explain, and repair inconsistencies in taxonomy alignments; and new techniques to reduce uncertainty in alignments. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL: http://www.daks.ucdavis.edu/projects/euler</Abstract>

Over the past century, an active research community has grown up around the available extensive genetic tools and diverse germplasm. In this time, maize has become a leading system for addressing fundamental questions in genetics such as the impact of domestication on genome structure, the molecular basis of heterosis (hybrid vigor), and role of transposons in genome evolution. Research on maize has led to major advances in our understanding of fundamental life processes in plants such as reproduction, seed formation, germination, photosynthesis, and biosynthesis of primary metabolites including amino acids, carbohydrates and fatty acids. A genome sequence is a logical next step to enable the best use of maize as an experimental system and in order to translate research advances into improved crops. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;At 2.6 billion base pairs, the maize genome is about the same size as the human genome. However, its organization is far more complex. More than 80% of the genome is made up of a complex mixture of repetitive DNA that includes several classes of retrotransposon. Only about 20% of the genome comprises the genes and these are scattered throughout the 10 chromosomes in small islands. A detailed physical map that is linked to the genetic map has been developed that covers more than 90% of the genome. Based on this detailed knowledge about the genome structure and organization, the maize research community has developed a description of the &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; for a genome sequence (http://www.maizegdb.org/genome/goldstandard.pdf). The gold standard maize genome is defined as containing the complete sequence and structures of all maize genes and their locations (in linear order) on both the genetic and physical maps of maize, using B73 as the reference genome.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is designed to provide a maize genome sequence as close to the gold standard as possible with the currently available technology. Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones of known location along the physical map will be sequenced to 6x coverage, and integrated with the available sequence information obtained through prior sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs), transposon insertion sites, gene-enriched genomic DNA and whole genome shotgun libraries. The resulting genome sequence will contain high quality sequence (fewer than one error per 100,000 bases) of the non-repetitive regions that include the genes and regulatory elements, anchored to the genetic and physical maps. The sequence will be annotated for gene models, predicted exon/intron structures, EST and full-length cDNA data, gene ontologies, and homologies with sequences from other organisms.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Educational activities that focus on maize and the genome sequence and aimed at K-12 students and their parents will be developed at Washington University St. Louis Genome Sequencing Center in collaboration with the St. Louis Science Center. Training resources, tutorials and workshops for end-users of the maize sequence appropriate for researchers, students, and breeders will be developed and made available through Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) located at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;All primary and assembled sequences over 2,000 base pairs in length will be deposited in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/) within 24 hours of generation. Trace files will be deposited in the NCBI Trace Repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi) within one week of production. Assembled, finished BAC clone sequences will be deposited in GenBank as soon as the finished sequence has passed all quality analysis tests and has been approved for submission by the quality analysis team. Project information and data will be available through a web site accessible through the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center (http://www.genome.wustl.edu). Maize sequence assemblies and maize genetic resources will be incorporated into Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) and MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org) on a quarterly basis. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Maize (corn) is one of the most economically important plants in the US. In 2004, 80.9 million acres of corn were planted with a production value of over $22 billion. While corn is grown in the U.S. for food and feed, it is also converted into a myriad of processed food products and serves as an important material for many industrial products. The maize genome sequence will be a key resource for continued use of maize as an experimental system for advancing fundamental biology as well as for the development of new and improved maize varieties in the public and private sector.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project was funded as part of the Maize Genome Sequencing Project: An NSF/DOE/USDA Joint Program.</Abstract>

<Abstract>From Bluetooth transceivers to the NASA Mars Rover, reconfigurable circuits have become one of the mainstays of embedded design. Combining the high computational performance of specialized circuits with the re-programmability of software, these devices are quickly becoming ubiquitous. Unfortunately, if unprotected, this reconfigurability could be exploited to disrupt critical operations, snoop on supposedly secure channels, or even to physically melt a device. However, a new approach to controlling changes to the hardware logic promises to overcome these problems. In addition, the innate malleability of this hardware presents the opportunity for hardware enforcement of adaptive security policies. For example, in an emergency, trusted individuals may need to override the nominal security policy. Thus, the reconfigurable component may provide a highly trusted mechanism for secure functionality in changing environments.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research aims to close a gaping security hole in our nation&amp;apos;s information infrastructure by enhancing the logical structure and internal management of reconfigurable hardware to enforce a dynamic information protection policy. Specifically, this research will: (1) discover hardware synthesis and static validation methods that will ensure that only secure and non-destructive configurations can be loaded, (2) develop new reconfigurable structures capable of securely mediating run-time access to shared resources through the use of hardware-compiled formal access policy languages, and (3) establish a firm foundation for trustworthy dynamic policy enforcement through ontological analysis, formal modeling and the development of management mechanisms integrating the results of the first two activities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>In this project a consortium of organizations is building an information infrastructure on the foundation of the current Materials Science Digital Library collection (MatDL) and assuming stewardship of significant content and services to support the integration of education and research in materials science (MS). Additionally, this Pathways project is facilitating the dissemination of resources generated by government-funded MS collaborations. The MatDL partnership includes information/library scientists and materials scientists affiliated with government and research/teaching institutions: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Kent State University, MIT, University of Michigan, Iowa State University, and Purdue University. To multiply the impact of NSF-supported materials efforts, this network of collaborations is being extended to include several related NSF initiatives: Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Teams, Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers, and International Materials Institutes. The intellectual merit of this effort lies in its provision of tools to describe, manage, exchange, archive, and disseminate data among national and international government-funded materials teams and centers; support for open access development of modeling and simulation tools; development of services and content for virtual labs in large undergraduate introductory science courses; and the maintenance of a workspace for collaborative development of core undergraduate MS teaching materials as well as ontological tools for enhanced resource discovery. The project exercises broader impact by serving as a dedicated hub for the large materials research community, facilitating communication and interactions among its members. MatDL offers the opportunity to create learning objects based on recent research, as well as convenient access to relevant, shared resources and learning objects. Because of its inherent interdisciplinary nature MatDL also has an impact on a large constellation of STEM disciplines. The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) is providing significant co-funding of this project in recognition of important role played by materials science education and research within the larger MPS portfolio of awards.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of California at San Diego is awarded a grant to develop tools for integrating biological literature and databases. Changes in the scientific publishing industry blur the distinction between biological databases and the biological literature and it is the time to capitalize on this hitherto unappreciated similarity. Tools will be developed to provide seamless integration between the knowledge and data traditionally held within biological journals with the related information, which is traditionally held within biological databases. The open source software tools are collectively called BioLit and will facilitate this integration and provide a broad community with the potential to achieve a new level of efficient comprehension of the products of the scientific endeavor. Initially, BioLit will comprise authoring tools to facilitate biologists in employing existing ontologies, post manuscript submission tools to extract relevant facts from the manuscript which are stored as metadata, a database of journal content and tools for the visualization and further analysis of data and knowledge presented in this database of on-line published papers. BioLit development and testing will be performed in a unique environment consisting of the complete corpus of Public Library of Science (PLoS) journals integrated with the Protein Data Bank (PDB), one of the oldest and most used databases in all biology. In the third year of the project an evaluation of the tools will be performed as will a survey of how useful the community regards what has been achieved in this initial phase. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Under a special agreement with the University of California tools from this effort will be open source and distributed through sourceforge.net and hence available to any publisher or database provider who cares to employ them. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity comes from, first, the application of the tools and principles defined herein to any field of science. Second, and most important, the proposal brings the promise to the scientific consumer of a new and powerful medium from which to learn. A medium that retains all of the intellectual merits of high quality scientific journals, achieved through peer review and high quality editing, yet adds direct access to the data upon which conclusions are reached. Conversely, access through biological databases provided transversal from a data point to the conclusions reached in the literature about that item of data. A positive evaluation of the integrative approach enabled by the tools proposed here could have a far-reaching impact on the means by which science is disseminated and consumed.</Abstract>

Palmer, PI&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;P. Bryan Heidorn, Co-PI&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This award supports the development of a biological informatics masters degree program for Scientific Communication Specialists (SCS). Unlike most existing educational programs in bioinformatics, the SCS program takes a broad view of biology and informatics to train professionals to bridge arenas of information technology development in the biological sciences. Based at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the program is building on a long-standing, top-rated masters of science in library and information science and a digital library certificate of advanced study program, and ongoing information technology research initiatives in biodiversity, neuroscience, and genomics. The objectives of the project are to develop curriculum, establish internships, integrate course work with informatics research, share the educational approach, and expand understanding of the role of informatics in scientific progress.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The SCS program is aimed at making progress toward the problem of &amp;quot;getting past the prototype&amp;quot; by educating information professionals responsible for the implementation, evaluation, continual improvement, sustainability, and integration of information and data systems about biology. SCS professionals are trained to exploit existing data standards and work toward &amp;quot;long-lived data&amp;quot; and interoperability, and to build and integrate the increasing number of digital libraries, repositories, indexing systems, ontologies, taxonomies, vocabularies, and tools associated with digital data and products. The impacts of SCS education include functional applications that are integrated with current scientific practice and greater attention to standards development, data curation, data and literature federation, and equitable dissemination of research results.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research project examines how the Seri people of Sonora, Mexico, categorize the landscape in which they live through their language. Under the supervision of Dr. Juergen Bohnemeyer and Dr. David Mark, Carolyn O&amp;apos;Meara will carry out a survey of parts of the Seri area selected in view of their geomorphologic and ecological diversity. She will record route descriptions that use land and water forms as natural landmarks and isolate landscape terms on the basis of a set of diagnostics derived from a detailed examination of the grammar of spatial reference in Seri. This work will be complemented by studies of landscape-related cultural practices (in particular, fishing and gathering expeditions) and the recording of biographical and local history narratives.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The study of the classification of land and water forms such as mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, and lakes and natural assemblages of vegetation is a new field of study in linguistics and cultural anthropology. The overarching research question is to what extent the classification of such entities reflects universal principles of cognition and to what extent it varies with language and culture, reflecting, for example, differences in the ways in which different cultures make use of their natural environment. Seri makes for a fascinating case study in this domain. The territory is highly diverse, including seashore, islands, and mangroves as well as mountainous and desert areas. The Seri people practiced hunting and gathering well into the 20th century and as such have particularly intimate knowledge of this richly varied landscape. But Seri is an endangered language, and due to economic changes, traditional knowledge of the landscape is rapidly becoming obsolete. The documentation of Seri landscape terminology provides future generations of Seri with lasting access to the ways of their ancestors. At the same time, the findings of this study will bear directly on theoretical issues such as the ontological properties and individuation of land and water forms.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This dissertation research is being supported by the Programs in Linguistics, Cultural Anthropology and Geography &amp;amp; Regional Science.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award funds a workshop to bring together ecological and environmental decision makers from government and non-government organizations, computer scientists, social scientists, ecologists and biologists, and funding and mission agencies to address how the emerging area of eco-informatics can be harnessed to help solve problems of ecological and environmental decision makers. Information technology issues to be addressed include: data gaps, data presentation, and how to use or create appropriate indicators. Computer science research areas to be included in the workshop discussion are: information integration, modeling and simulation, data quality, ontologies, human-centered issues such as training, technology transfer, best practices for information provision and use, and human-friendly software for decision makers and information providers. Thirty-five participants from the resource management, computer science and social science research, and mission agencies will attend. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The primary outcome of the workshop is a January 2005 report to be widely disseminated, defining the problems faced by ecological and environmental decision makers, the research that might begin to address those problems, and the likely impact on specific decision making scenarios. The aim is to help program officers from mission and research funding agencies better understand how new information products and information technology can foster better ecological and environmental decisions. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Resource managers and decisions makers will have the opportunity to articulate problems and see them expressed in the report; they will gain a better understanding of the current state of the art of information technology, and what promise technology has to offer for future improvements. Participants from the research community will learn about new research problems and competitive opportunities. Both decision makers and researchers will have opportunities to learn about potential collaborators. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The report will briefly address how new research and resource management policy might be integrated into curricular design in ecology, biology, computer science, social science, mathematics, and engineering, to be informed by a report from students providing logistical support at the workshop.</Abstract>

<Abstract>9817569&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Hornstein &amp;amp; Uriagereka&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;ABSTRACT&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Chomsky calls a &amp;apos;Strong Minimalist Thesis&amp;apos; the conjecture that language &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;is a perfect solution to interface conditions. The language faculty is &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;thought to interact with other faculties of mind, including those responsible &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for articulation/perception and intentionality/conceptualization. That&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;interaction determines crucial properties of linguistic representations. In &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;turn, the linguistic system is seen as computational, and optimal in the &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;derivation of interface representations. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The conjecture opens an obvious research program. To begin with, it forces&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;us to rethink many notions that sustained the Principles and Parameters&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;framework. For instance, we are not allowed to arbitrarily postulate levels&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of representations or give mere notational conventions a deep ontological&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;status. More profoundly, if the linguistic system is computational, and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;optimally so, derivational dynamics, crucially sensitive to complexity, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;should be responsible for a variety of effects which were previously taken &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to follow from static primitive conditions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Whether the strong minimalist thesis is tenable will depend on how well it&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;explains the wealth of data that previous models accounted for, and how &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;naturally it fits within the general enterprise of studying the human mind. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The present research tries to undertake these goals within the Linguistics&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Department at the University of Maryland, as well as its Cognitive Science&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and Neuroscience program.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This collaborative research project seeks to explore the applicability of paradigms from the art world to the science of software design. The project will build and evaluate a framework called ARTISAN for service oriented architecture by developing a new model called ?Movie View? to provide an immersive and animated graphical representation for facilitating the design process for Service Oriented Architecture. This shall include ?Movie-Showing,? a form of process modeling for software systems design. The project will implement a prototype to map between story-telling methods, using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) models, and movie-showing methods. An application based on ARTISAN for use in an emergency-response setting shall be implemented as proof of concept. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in recognizing common elements of the design process in apparently disparate fields and exploring the value of adding a visually rich simulation element to the software design life cycle. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will incorporate design paradigms from the art and film world into the software design curriculum. A new software engineering course shall be introduced and an existing software engineering course modified for using and evaluating ARTISAN. The didactic component will feature guest lectures on design in art and film, and carefully chosen projects that experiment with incorporating enabling features of these external paradigms. The didactic component of the project will give participating students the skills necessary to be the leaders of the next generation of software system designers.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This workshop centers around the idea that delimiting biological objects cannot be determined by empirical facts alone; which facts are salient depend on theoretical and conceptual context. Bringing together philosophers and biologists working on these conceptual issues, discussion will focus on particular cases drawn from a wide range of the biological hierarchy.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit. By highlighting conceptual problems that are common across different fields of biology and philosophy, researchers will be encouraged to apply approaches and conceptual frameworks common in one field to analogous problems in other fields. In using actual case studies to achieve this goal, a new hybrid approach to philosophical and conceptual work in philosophy will be generated. In addition to the growing list of speakers covering a wide range of research areas in both biology and philosophy of biology, the workshop dovetails with the research interests of the primary co-organizers. Both Odenbaugh and Haber&amp;apos;s research interests involve issues concerning the ontological status of biological objects. Odenbaugh&amp;apos;s research involves conceptual issues in ecology, and he is currently concerned with delimiting ecosystems and other ecological kinds. Haber is working on issues in systematics, including drawing a distinction between ambiguity and uncertainty in taxonomic reference, and how either may affect taxonomic stability. The University of Utah has offered strong institutional support for this project, and an enthusiastic set of speakers have already informally committed to participate.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;BROADER IMPACTS This workshop is organized around a diversity of actual biological cases. Each case will receive comments from at least one philosopher and one biologist. In addition to creating new partnerships and enhancing existing networks between like-minded researchers from a range of disciplines, the workshop will extend its impact through publication of the case studies, commentaries, and ensuing discussions. These proceedings will be published as a special issue of a journal, with accompanying web material available for consumption (e.g., podcasts of discussion following commentaries on cases). Presenting actual cases that illustrate philosophically salient problems will help display the value of biological literacy to more generalist philosophers, as well as the value of philosophical analysis to biologists. Modern physics proved to contain rich source material for philosophers generally, who in turn have helped (and continue to help) develop an understanding of the importance and consequence of modern physics. Advances in biology have not been as well appreciated by the general philosophical community, despite the rich philosophical material it presents - a situation we hope to remedy with this workshop. This workshop will identify emerging and underdeveloped fields of research in philosophy of biology, and spur research in these fields by bringing together junior researchers that are still mapping out their research interests. Developing interdisciplinary networks across disciplines between these researchers is one of the expected outcomes of this workshop, which will have an impact on the kind of research pursued by the next generation of philosophers of biology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project supports U.S. participation in an international Network to work toward achieving interoperability among language resources, for which parallel European support has been provided by the European Commission eContentplus Programme. The Network involves members of the language processing community and related areas who are working to build consensus regarding the sharing of data and technologies for language resources and applications, interoperability of existing data and tools, and the promotion of standards for resource building and annotation. The participation of colleagues in Asia is also being sought. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The resources and technologies to be addressed include annotated corpora (texts, audio), lexicons, ontologies, automatic speech recognizers, lemmatizers, taggers for all levels of linguistic phenomena, named entity recognizers, information extractors, as well as systems for search, access, and annotation. The creation and use of these resources span the field of linguistics and several related but relatively isolated disciplines within computer science and engineering, including natural language text and speech processing, information retrieval, machine translation, and the semantic web. The goal is to turn existing, fragmented technologies and resources developed within these groups in relative isolation into accessible, stable, and interoperable resources that can be readily reused across several areas. This project is being funded through the INTEROP solicitation in the Office of Cyberinfrastructure, with funding also from the Directorates of Social, Behavioral &amp;amp; Economic Sciences and Computer &amp;amp; Information Science &amp;amp; Engineering, and the Office of International Science &amp;amp; Engineering.</Abstract>

<Abstract>We live in the information age, a time when data and knowledge is plentiful and easily moved, processed and mined by machines. This makes it easier to discover knowledge and more efficiently manage our affairs but also increases concerns about information confidentiality, privacy and trust. Balancing these will be a defining challenge in the coming decades and is particularly urgent today in organizations responsible for national defense, law enforcement, emergency services, and public health and safety. The 9/11 Commission addressed this in their report and called for &amp;quot;a paradigm change from Need to Know to Need to Share&amp;quot;. This project will explore one concrete aspect of this shift -- how executable policies can help organizations enhance their ability to share information and access while still maintaining appropriate levels of security, confidentiality and privacy.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the University of Texas at San Antonio and the University of Texas at Dallas will build on existing work at our three institutions to develop and refine a a conceptual framework for computational policies to support information sharing in a need to share environment. Our framework will integrate and extend our work on access control (RBAC), usage control (UCON) and deontic policies (REI), grounding them in ontologies expressed in the Semantic Web language OWL. We will use it to design a policy specification language and enumerate required software artifacts and tools. Finally, we will study the framework applicability to realistic applications such as the management of healthcare records and homeland security related data.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Researchers have developed a software framework that helps to automatically define, acquire and consume cloud based services. A simple prototype demonstrating some of these features was successfully demonstrated at a recent cloud computing conference. Researchers are now looking to address some key open questions and create a more robust version of this prototype or a &amp;quot;cloud broker&amp;quot; tool that will enable users to select the best suited service (or a combination of services) from the plethora of services/providers in the market. Unlike much of the existing work, this will involve (automated) negotiation between the service provider and the consumer to arrive at a machine understandable and processable service-level agreement (SLA). Such a system addresses a key identified gap in existing cloud technology. The research team plans to use Semantically Web (W3C standard) languages to build the prototype. They have developed ontologies and rules to describe cloud services, requirements, security and privacy. This solution may have the ability to capture and leverage federal cloud standards currently in development.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Customers are currently acquiring cloud services manually by hiring consultants to review and compare the services and conditions (terms, pricing, compliance, security etc.) being offered by the cloud providers, establish SLAs, and then monitor SLAs during usage. This is a very time consuming and human intensive process which reduces return on investments and impacts security and privacy. As a result, large organizations with complex enterprise policies are unable to use full potential of the cloud. There is a market need for a well-researched, tested solution that addresses these barriers to cloud adoption.</Abstract>

It will create a database query system, a Genetic Query language, which will allow biological researchers to successfully extract individually formatted information from multiple disparate databases in which bio and genomic information is currently located. The work will incorporate bioscientists, computer scientists, and mathematicians to accomplish the following goals.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Identify genome-centric database research issues and develop database support in the form of interconnecting disparate genomic databases on the Internet and facilitate intelligent retrieval of data using novel query languages.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Develop an easy-to-use one-step query browser, which will provide a unified view of various genomic databases on the World Wide Web.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Develop efficient and scalable solution algorithms based on multiscale analysis and domain decomposition for modeling and simulating important biological processes described by systems of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, and implement these algorithms on multiprocessor parallel computers using novel dynamic scheduling and load balancing strategies for large scale computations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project also suggests a mechanism for allowing researchers to query heterogeneous distributed databases for genetic information without many of the current impediments and develops scalable methods for domain decomposition that would allow efficient use of multiprocessor computer systems for modeling large-scale biological processes. In addition, educational activities in computational biology would be enhanced through development of new course materials, involvement of undergraduate students in research projects, and the conduct of summer student workshops. Participation of members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering will be encouraged and facilitated in each of these activities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project is an effort to improve the ease of use of data from ocean observations by developing broader agreement within the ocean science community on &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; for marine metadata. It brings together a number of segments of the ocean science community in an effort to document current usage, to develop a consensus on &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot;, and to test the best practices and their effectiveness at promoting cross-platform, cross-disciplinary data exchange in a test-bed activity. The goal is to reduce the burden of metadata generation, increase the use of metadata, and develop a general metadata structure that supports a wide variety of data usage. The test-bed will provide an end-to-end demonstration of the use of metadata &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; in an environment with heterogeneous data types.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The volume and variety of ocean data from modern observing systems are expanding rapidly and it becomes difficult to find or effectively use these data without assistance from modern data management and data analysis tools. These tools place the burden of searching for and manipulating data onto computer programs. To be able to successfully do this requires that datasets include descriptions of the data they contain, and details of how they have been obtained and processed, that are stored in a form that can be understood by these programs. To be machine-readable, this metadata must conform to semantic and syntactic standards that are understood by the programs. This project aims to combine the best of existing practices for generating metadata into recipes for voluntary de facto community standards. Experience with how to develop metadata and associated ontologies has emerged in a number of fields and this will be fused with existing marine metadata practices. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, this project will develop a more comprehensive approach to ocean metadata and facilitate its adoption by marine scientists. More complete metadata that conforms to a community standard will enhance the ability of many users to employ ocean observations more effectively. The impact is likely to be felt most directly by the academic research and &amp;quot;operational&amp;quot; ocean nowcasting or forecasting communities. Indirectly, this is likely to benefit a number of ocean data users such as coastal ocean resource managers and commercial users by easing and expanding their access to relevant data.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Tim Berners Lee has defined the semantic web to support machine understandable web pages. Much of the development in semantic web has been on standards for XML (eXtensible Markup Language), RDF (Resource Description Framework), Ontologies and Information Interoperability. For the semantic web to be useful in an operational environment, it has to be dependable. By a dependable semantic web we mean a semantic web that is secure, privacy-enhanced, manages trust, processes information in real-time and ensures high quality data. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The objective of this project will be to investigate policies for the semantic web. In particular, the web rules language will be expended to include the specification of security and privacy policies. The project will also develop an inference engine to reason about the policies. Privacy and trust policies for the semantic web and develop algorithms to enforce the policies.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A most basic form of human social interaction is the physical cooperation necessary to perform a manual task in pairs (dyads) or groups. This project will explore how the human sensorimotor control system implements cooperative motor control. In preliminary work, the project team has demonstrated that when a dyad embarks on a repeated simple manual task requiring speed and accuracy, motor strategies quickly arise that not only differ significantly from individual strategies on the same task, but also provide better performance. This result runs counter to conventional wisdom that high accuracy tasks are best performed by one individual alone. Nevertheless, from both evolutionary and ontological perspectives, the result is reasonable: humans are social animals and have developed sophisticated ways of working together physically. Motor interactions represent a social communication mechanism distinct from facial expression, gesture, and spoken language.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project team encompasses cognitive science, neurobiology, robotics, and sensorimotor control, and will:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Investigate the language of physical communication between two or more individuals as they develop a cooperative strategy to perform a mechanical task. Identify channels of this communication, for instance modulation of arm stiffness. Investigate the adaptation that underlies the emergence of cooperative behaviors during physical communication, as the participants negotiate, compromise, specialize, teach and learn, or in some other way arrive at an effective cooperative behavior.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Investigate cognitive influences on cooperative behaviors. Determine the extent to which the cooperative behaviors reflect cognitive influences on motor control, as opposed to implicit or inherent biomechanical properties of the sensorimotor system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Investigate the emergent behaviors as specifically social phenomena. Assess their extension to groups sizes of more than two, and the social aspects of adaptation, such as the effect of errors or &amp;quot;breaches of trust.&amp;quot; Investigate the substitution of an automated partner (robot) for a human partner.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Investigate the factors at the sensorimotor level that allow dyadic motion control to optimize performance better than individual motor control. Hypotheses include reduction in delays associated with the triphasic burst pattern of muscle activation, and the partitioning of motor noise into separate spaces.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader impacts include: improving our fundamental understanding of therapist/patient interactions during physical or occupational therapy, many aspects of which are repetitive dyadic physical interaction. The work may also lead to better ways to make use of the social dynamics between individuals in physical interaction, which would be relevant to situations such as hands-on teaching/learning a in sports training or helicopter flight training, shared control of teleoperators or of unmanned aerial or underwater vehicles, and shared control of minimally invasive surgery or telesurgery.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The purpose of this project is to come to a more explicit understanding of what good scientific reasoning looks like, what sorts of knowledge and abilities contribute to it, how teachers can help students develop that knowledge, and what aspects of early scientific reasoning we can identify as the seeds of later sophistication. Prior research suggests that young children have a variety of intellectual resources for understanding science: they have extensive knowledge about physical causes and effects, at least concerning objects and phenomena they encounter every day; they have a variety of abilities for working with and adding to that knowledge; and most have skills for defending a position with reasons and evidence. Prior research also suggests that science teaching does not generally help children refine their everyday thinking. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will include four types of studies: 1) Detailed case studies of K-16 students&amp;apos; reasoning in physical science and physics, recorded on videotape and transcribed for line-by-line analysis; 2) the construction of computational models that try to reproduce aspects of students&amp;apos; reasoning; 3) the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the progression from childhood abilities to the expertise of a college major; and 4) applying that framework to generate and explore hypotheses for what instructional actions might promote good scientific reasoning and understanding.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Under this project, researchers at the University of Maine and the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) are collaborating to study new models for integrating geographic information. The two research teams complement each other, providing a unique synergy in conceptual modeling and systems development. Long-term visits by Brazilian researchers assure a tight cooperation, and provide for integrated research and education. The work focuses on the semantics of spatial data collections that are stored in geographic information systems or spatial databases. Such collections often have diverse database schemas and lack conventions that would make them easily compatible, so that they could be combined to perform an integrated analysis. The goal of this research is to develop computational models that will allow us to compare, harmonize, and integrate geographic information across different ontologies and different spatial data models. The approach consists of a new integrated method to assess similarity based on common parts, functions, and attributes. In these similarity assessments, different contexts are considered through the operations a user intents to perform with the harmonized data. The results of this project will provide meaningful comparisons and integration of geospatial information, enabling better interoperation among geographic information systems.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~max/CNPq.html</Abstract>

<Abstract>Mobile computing and wireless networks have dramatically changed both the distributed systems communication paradigm and the ways that people access and manipulate information. Consequently, there is now widespread recognition of a strong need for context-aware computing in numerous application domains, particularly applications that assist in the management of emergency situations. Such applications will dynamically adjust to individual user profiles, user locations, the local environment, and the task being performed. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project focuses on context-aware computing with applications to public health management. Core research issues in data management that are relevant to context-aware computing will be investigated. Also, the architecture of a system that supports context-aware applications with dynamically evolving data will be developed. Data integration tools and ontologies will be studied and then applied to actual source data and user profiles. This activity will be augmented with techniques for building spatio-temporal context from location traces. Methodologies will be developed to ensure the scalability of the system, including the use of request aggregation and of data cubes for caching user profiles and retrieved data. Security issues will be addressed by investigating an authentication model for spatio-temporal context based on a distributed trust framework. The architecture will also incorporate a component for the arbitration of services that can manage on-demand resource allocation in a competitive environment.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the quality, responsiveness, and delivery accuracy of services using context-aware computing. The focus on health care services, both in routine and in crisis situations (e.g., terrorist attacks, natural disasters) has the potential to contribute to an improved technology infrastructure for the public health sector nationwide.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The central mission of the THREDDS project is to make it possible for educators and researchers to publish, locate, analyze, and visualize in a wide variety of educational settings. In the initial phase THREDDS established a solid, working prototype of services and tools to enable data providers to create inventory catalogs of the data holdings at their site and educational module builders to author compound documents with embedded pointers to environmental datasets and analysis tools. These catalogs and data-interactive&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;documents can then be harvested into digital libraries using standard protocols. THREDDS Second Generation (THREDDS2G) is expanding the team of contributors and the breadth of data in the collections, taking advantage of recent technological advancements, and integrating THREDDS technologies with emerging standards and related environmental data systems. In addition it is actively engaging new disciplines and incorporating new tools that are making the end products more useful at all educational levels, for decision makers and for the general public. THREDDS2G significantly augments and expands the existing project as it breaks entirely new ground in several areas. The main objectives fall into the following categories:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. Interactive Educational Modules: work with the community of educational content builders and data providers to create educational modules that incorporate facilities for finding and interacting with environmental datasets.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Enhanced Metadata Catalogs: Using tools and inventory catalogs implemented in the initial phase, develop additional catalogs with significantly enhanced metadata to simplify the process of finding and using scientific data, developing standards and tools for enhanced metadata, incorporating scientific ontologies, and implementing scientific data models.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3. Interoperability with Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Create interoperable data systems with coherent connectivity and access to GIS data using GIS and traditional THREDDS clients.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;4. Dataset Search and Discovery and Other Web Services: Working collaboratively with NSDL and DLESE, ensure that THREDDS systems evolve toward compatibility with emerging standards in Web services.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;5. Education-oriented, Standards-based Client Software: Integrate an education-oriented GIS client analysis and display application called MyWorld to THREDDS data services.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;While THREDDS is a highly collaborative project, the Unidata Program Center is leading and coordinating the development, disseminating the software, and supporting the THREDDS community. With strong new partnerships that include leading organizations in K-12 educational technology, hydrology, solid Earth studies, societal impacts, and GIS, the impact of THREDDS2G will extend well beyond even the vast Unidata audience. Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences in recognition of the importance that this project has on the development of software tools for accessing, cataloging and analyzing content of environmental datasets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single international repository and primary source for information about the structure of biological macromolecules. As such, it is a key research resource and a central component to our understanding of living systems. The PDB serves a broad community of experimental, structural and computational scientists and serves as a resource for educators at all levels. PDB access is provided through primary web and ftp sites (www.pdb.org, ftp.pdb.org) or via 7 mirror sites distributed worldwide. The goal of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Biology (RCSB) in managing PDB is to provide a single, searchable archive of accurate and well-annotated data on experimentally determined macromolecular structure. Systems developed by RCSB are currently being used for data processing, archiving, distribution and query, as well as maintenance of the physical archive. In the current project period, new activities are planned as follows. First, data processing is being improved by increasing accuracy and speed of processing, ensuring that the entire archive is as uniform and error free as possible, and creating the infrastructure to support automated data deposition and exchange functions. Second, data archiving, distribution and query capabilities are being improved by implementing a new system for distribution and archiving of all PDB data, and enabling comprehensive structural data analyses regardless of geographic location, local hardware, or software configuration. Finally, completion and maintenance of a comprehensive physical archive is being undertaken to ensure the preservation of primary data and of all records associated with the transactions of the database including documents describing its evolution and maintenance. The result of this effort will be a significant improvement in the utility and value of the Protein Data Bank for both specialists and non-specialists alike. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Mechanisms for increasing the broader impacts of this work include the following: a series of workshops and meeting sessions, active participation in scientific meetings, a regular newsletter, the on-going use of a help desk to increase the access and utility of PDB for the specialist and non-specialist research community, and use of focus groups to insure maximum usability of PDB data. Participation in graduate and undergraduate coursework design and implementation and in structured research opportunities is being used to increase the impact of PDB on university-level education. Participation in teacher training workshops and a collaborative effort to launch a teacher development program provide opportunities to bring PDB resources to the K/12 environment. The general public is being made aware of PDB efforts through a traveling art exhibit and through frequent news releases and informational programs. Collectively, these efforts will extend the benefits of PDB resources and activities to the broadest possible community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>In the past decade, the Web has become one of the most used and transformative social applications in the history of human communications. Our everyday use of the Web depends on fundamental developments in computer science that took place long before the Web was invented. Today?s search engines, for example, are based on developments in information retrieval with a legacy going back to the 1960s. The innovations of the 1990s provided the crucial algorithms underlying the modern search engines that are so fundamental to Web use. Many interesting aspects of Web use, such as social networking, tagging, data integration, information retrieval, and Web ontologies, have emerged as ?social computing? at some of the top information schools and computing programs. However, in too many cases the Web is studied exclusively as a technical or social artifact rather than as an object of study in its own right, whose architectural properties actively shape the human interactions it supports. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results of this project will define interdisciplinary methodologies that can be used to help develop the critical science, technology, and eventually curriculum at the heart of the emerging interdisciplinary field of Web Science. We will focus on establishing the methods of understanding and developing systems that allow large numbers of users to work together to form communities to solve scientific and social problems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Navigating in online virtual worlds is similar to searching the Web prior to the development of the first search engine. Users can find regions of interest to them through serendipity, by browsing or word of mouth, but they can only search the specific world they are on. This exploratory project investigates an enabling mobile crawler technology that can collect information across multiple worlds, and allows virtual worlds to grow in a distributed, multi-server, multi-platform manner. Of particular interest is content in 3D environments that is interconnected with the traditional flat Web. In this research explores strategies for gathering content from 3D environments and, using that content, gain a better understanding of how users are utilizing 3D environments and how they might benefit from more accessible, cross-platform search services. Crawling in 3D environments has many similarities with flat Web crawling but has additional constraints that may constrain how much content can reasonably be collected. The gathered data will further be explored, e.g., how frequently content changes in 3D environments and how users utilize linking in virtual worlds as compared to the linkage structures on the Web. In addition, this project investigates how traffic patterns in 3D environments are related to links, recommendations, and groups. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research challenges in this project are: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) Gathering content from distributed 3D environments. This includes approaches for navigating around the 3D environment for information collection are explored, mapping the 3D environment space, analysis of the impact of additional information that can only be collected via interaction, and characterization of the additional information that is available through internal and external links.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(2) Gaining a better understanding of user behavior. Research focuses on investigating ways in which user linkage patterns are similar to, and different from, user linkages on the flat Web and whether or not avatar traffic can be used to identify sites of broader user interest that can be exploited by the search process.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(3) Supporting search across multiple platforms. The aim is to develop a 3D 3D object ontologies and a schema, similar to RSS, that will enable virtual world servers to more easily support sharing of their data with an external search service.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;As 3D environments become both more prevalent and more diverse, the need for a cross-platform search service will continue to grow. By increasing the visibility of content across platforms and servers, this project will allow content creators to focus on creating higher quality 3D environment by providing effective search mechanism for finding the desired content in a large, distributed, virtual world.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The expected results are expected to provide foundations for exploring questions of how to discover and rank a wide range of content in virtual reality, mirror world, and augmented reality environments. By creating an open platform, this project will provide opportunities for more researchers to work in 3D environments. The database of regions, traffic, and linkages will be made available for downloading and analysis by other researchers. Research results, gathered data and the crawler will be made available as freeware via the project Web site (http://virtualworldsearch.uark.edu).</Abstract>

<Abstract>The world we live in is dynamic on all scales. On a small scale, think of walking across a room or driving to the grocery store; on a large scale, imagine a hurricane crossing a state. Research that addresses how humans understand relationships between space and time is, therefore, central not only to geography, but also to cognitive and information sciences. The objectives of this project are two-fold: to develop a research framework for examining how movement patterns at the geographic scale (MPGS) are understood, and to evaluate how formalisms used in geographic information science are able to capture how people understand MPGS. Linking cognitive and formal characterizations enables models that align with how people think about large scale spatial processes, thereby enhancing communication at the interface between humans and computers. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Dr. Alexander Klippel at the Pennsylvania State University will conduct a set of experiments that are based on a grouping paradigm that is used to elicit conceptual knowledge (i.e., categorization). Participants view animations of large-scale spatial phenomena ending at different spatio-temporal stages. For example, participants will look at 63 different animations of a hurricane approaching shore, making landfall, and finally moving far inland. Participants will then classify these animations based on their similarities. The question these studies are attempting to answer is whether formal, topologically equivalent characterizations across different domains (e.g., whether the moving entity is a hurricane or a glacier) are also equivalent cognitively. In other words, how does the semantics of dynamic features influence the cognitive conceptualizations thereof? Does semantics change the cognitive salience of individual topological relations? Additionally, the project will address the geographically critical question of scale effects and a contribution will be made to the formal underpinning of geographic event language by relating the conceptualizations of movement patterns to linguistic externalizations. To accomplish these goals, the PI has developed software to both collect and analyze behavioral data efficiently. The software to analyze the data will be developed within existing geovisual analytics software developed at the GeoVISTA Center in the Geography Department at the Pennsylvania State University.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will contribute to the understanding of how humans conceptualize movement patterns at the geographic scale, such as hurricanes moving across a peninsula, from the perspective of how these movement patterns are characterized formally. Connecting formal and cognitive characterizations of spatio-temporal information is essential to develop efficient human-computer interfaces and models of spatial cognition. This project will develop software solutions for the design of experiments and the efficient analysis of the collected data using visual analytics approaches. As cognitive conceptualizations are core to research on ontologies and categorization, and also to fields such as anthropology, we expect both the developed research framework and the software solutions to be beneficial to a large research community.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of Delaware is awarded a grant to develop a bioinformatics research infrastructure for integrated understanding of plant protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) in a systems biology context. While PTMs play a pivotal role in numerous biological processes by modulating regulation of protein function, activity and cellular localization, critical gaps remain in the current research framework for studying PTMs. To support the studies of important PTMs in plants -- phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, myristoylation and ubiquitination -- this project integrates text mining, data mining, data analysis and visualization tools, and databases and ontologies into a cross-cutting research resource needed to address the knowledge gaps in exploring and discovering PTM networks. A plant-specific resource, iPTMnet, is developed to capture relevant PTM information and their functional impact, such as interacting proteins, function, pathway, subcellular location, expression, and associated phenotypes. The underlying bioinformatics framework connects PTM enzyme-substrate relationships, connects major PTMs that may work in concert, and connects PTM forms to biological contexts and across taxa. The web portal unifies the fragmented and sporadic information into a biologically meaningful context, allowing biologists to search, browse, visualize PTM in protein networks and pathway maps, conduct use cases, and capture expert knowledge via community annotation. Scientific case studies are developed to demonstrate the integrative bioinformatics approach for hypothesis generation, coupled with lab validation of selected in silico analysis. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The iPTMnet bioinformatics resource adopts common standards to promote interoperability for broad dissemination. The Plant PTM Bioinformatics workshops are hosted at the Symposium on Plant Protein Phosphorylation to engage plant researchers as users and collaborators to advance community annotation and infrastructure development. Outreach effort includes tutorials, use cases and training materials as on-line resources, and training workshops at conferences and universities, especially EPSCoR institutions. This research project is incorporated into undergraduate and graduate course curriculum as well as research internships for students from area institutions, including high schools, undergraduate and minority institutions. This bioinformatics cyberinfrastructure addresses the knowledge gaps in the understanding of PTM networks and will facilitate the basic understanding of PTM-mediated biological processes and discovery of new knowledge in plant biology. The resource and research outcomes produced by this ABI Development project are integrated with the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR) and accessible by the broad research community on the web (http://proteininformationresource.org/iPTMnet).</Abstract>

<Abstract>9310624 Ereshefsky Linneaus developed his system of classifying animals and plants to accord with the biological theory of his day, namely a theory based on creationism and essentialism. Linneaus assumed that God created an initial pair of organisms for each species and after God&amp;apos;s original creation no new species could arise. Contemporary biology, of course, does not contain such tenets. The source of species is not God but evolution through natural selection and various other biological processes. Despite the abandonment of Linneaus&amp;apos; biological assumptions, the Linnaean System is still the preferred framework for constructing classifications of the organic world. However, with the advent of evolutionary theory, the Linnaean System faces numerous problems that undermine its effectiveness. The Linnaean System has lost its theoretical basis and has become both cumbersome and ontologically vacuous. Yet, there is currently no thorough study of the problems confronting the Linnaean System. Dr. Ereshefsky, under this grant, is providing just such a study. Another aim for Dr. Ereshefsky is to investigate an alternative taxonomic system, namely Willi Hennig&amp;apos;s 1969 numerical system. Preliminary work indicates that Hennig&amp;apos;s system can overcome many of the problems facing the Linnaean System. ***</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to establish that a units-based approach to retrieving quantitative data from scientific and technical documents is a powerful alternative to keyword and document based search models. Keyword approaches to data extraction and contextualization are limited due to poor semantic contextualization and because quantities are often written in a wide variety of numeric and unit formats. The proposed approach to reliable numeric data extraction begins with quantity-intelligent indexing that recognizes many numeric formats and converts quantities to standardized base-unit tokens, to significantly enhance search recall over keyword approaches. The resulting number-unit pairs will anchor the index to enable efficient scientific exploratory search with high semantic precision, but without overly relying on sophisticated imposed semantic ontologies. Research will focus on a proprietary search-time data scoring algorithm that utilizes context-sensitive numeric spectra, to score otherwise ambiguous results based on probabilistic methods. This approach is expected to improve both precision and recall of contextual numeric data extraction. In turn, the resulting search engine will enable instant visualization and analysis of collective technology landscapes and trends, which will guide researchers in any area of technology represented by the indexed documents.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact of this project will be to enable reliable and efficient extraction of numeric data from diverse sources such as scientific literature and patent databases. These unstructured document sets contain a wealth of latent quantitative data which, if properly extracted and aggregated, can enable powerful modes of data exploration. The unit-based index and data-scoring algorithm are customized for an exploratory search model that will allow non-expert users to rapidly aggregate thousands of relevant data points, with simple keyword inputs and without laboriously opening and parsing individual documents. Researchers and students may thus explore data sets that were previously inaccessible, or known only to experts in a field. This will also contribute to knowledge discovery within large unstructured databases, since patterns and correlations between seemingly disparate variables can be immediately visualized. The platform will provide the capability to efficiently generate technology landscapes, anticipate emerging trends, and recognize competitive technical outliers. If successful, this will be valuable for high-tech industrial innovation including for engineers involved in R&amp;amp;D as well as business development executives and intellectual asset managers who focus on asset allocation, new technology ventures, prior art and patent infringement within a technical parameter space.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on a novel approach to develop units-based numeric indexing and search tools. The goal is to extract numeric quantities from technical literature, identify each with a corresponding physical unit, and further relate these to other identified semantic entities such as device properties. Unlike generic semantic information extraction strategies, which attempt to identify ambiguous structure with AI learning algorithms, Entanglement Technologies? solution capitalizes on the standardization and universality of units. Physical quantities are identified accurately with scientific heuristics in knowledge-rich contexts, and thus numeric search can be more efficient than keyword searches. The research objectives are to design and optimize these scientific heuristics across a wide array of physical units to intelligently extract numeric data. Concurrently, Entanglement will develop detailed scientific ontologies for identifying the context of an indexed number-unit pair.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Successful demonstration of this project offers the potential for rapid and accurate data mining for technical and scientific specifications. This will have broad applications in industrial and scientific research. Entanglement Technologies anticipates generating licensing revenue from access to this search technology, targeting financial institutions involved in high-tech investments and academic libraries providing scientific search capabilities. The ability to define comprehensive, yet objective, heuristics for contextualizing a number removes much of the user&amp;apos;s responsibility for identifying the correctness of the search engine?s retrieval. This inherent feature provides a non-expert with the capability for searching, aggregating and analyzing technical data currently only processed by experts. Furthermore, units-based numeric search offers the potential for automated number extraction and aggregation. Entanglement will utilize this capability by integrating its search functionality into a front-end user-friendly package, allowing a customer to benefit not only from the search but also from streamlined graph and report generation. If successful, this potential for automation will reduce the cost of such services currently provided by technical consulting firms.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</Abstract>

<Abstract>The second workshop on Resource Discovery (RED) is co-located with&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;the 35th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;on August 28, 2009, in Lyon, France. This project provides travel fellowships &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;to students enrolled in US universities in order to attend the workshop.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The workshop is concerned with the design and development of models and &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;prototypes that support the representation of resources, the discovery of &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;resources on the Web, the identification, localisation, and composition of &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;resources. A resource corresponds to an information source such as a data &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;repository or database management system (e.g., a query form or a textual &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;search engine), a link between resources (an index or hyperlink), or a service &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;such as an application or tool. Resources are characterized by core information &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;including a name, a description of its input and its output (parameters or format), &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;its address, and various additional properties expressed as metadata. Resource &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;discovery is the process of identifying and locating existing resources that have a &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;particular property. Machine-based resource discovery relies on crawling, clustering, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;and classifying resources discovered on the Web automatically. Resources are &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;organized with respect to metadata that characterize their content (for data sources), &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;their semantics (in terms of ontological classes and relationships), their characteristics &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(syntactical properties), their performance (with metrics and benchmarks), their quality &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(curation, reliability, trust), etc. Resource discovery systems allow the expression of &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;queries to identify and locate resources that implement specific tasks.

<Abstract>The biological sciences are advancing by posing increasingly complex and quantitative questions which require experiments that are increasingly complex procedures, and analysis of increasingly complex and large data sets. Information technology is pervasive throughout this process. Before beginning the laboratory work, computation is necessary for planning the experiment, and for later analysis of the results. In gene chip experiments for determining gene activity levels, planning issues include which biological hypotheses should be considered and what chemical conditions will yield the most informative results, followed by computation to reduce the collected data, which can be gigabytes of information, to forms that can be understood and exploited by biological scientists. In electron microscope experiments for determining the 3-D structure of viruses, planning issues include electron energy, defocus level, beam current, number of tilts, and tilt angles, followed by computation to reduce the measured data, which can be one hundred thousand or more images, to a biologically-plausible 3-D structure. Historically, insufficient attention has been devoted to the use of highly sophisticated information technology for quantitative planning and analysis of experiments, which jointly takes into account the behavior of the measurement apparatus, the goals of the experiment, the unavoidable uncertainty in the system, and the algorithmic complexity that a particular experimental design implies for the subsequent computational analysis of the experimental data. The research objective of this ITR project is to bring together a team of investigators from MIT, Purdue and NYU-Courant along with their industrial collaborators to apply principles from information, coding and systems theory, along with advanced computational methods for statistical inference and numerical optimization, to create a unified approach to planning and analysis of complex quantitative experiments in the biological sciences, such as the determination of gene expression using gene chips and the determination of 3-D viral structure from scattering and electron microscopy experiments. These biological problems will challenge the state of the art in information technology and an important characteristic of the project is the parallel development of new information technology and new biological applications. The human-resources objectives of this ITR project are to provide the opportunity for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates to learn about and contribute to this exciting area at the interface between information technology and biological sciences. Because of the biological focus of the research it is anticipated that the proposed project will be an outstanding opportunity to recruit women and other underrepresented minorities into the Systems, Information and Computer Science endeavor.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a recent form of declarative programming that has been applied to many knowledge-intensive tasks, such as product configuration, planning, diagnosis, and information integration. Like other computing paradigms, such as SAT (Satisfiability Checking) and CP (Constraint Programming), ASP provides a common basis for formalizing and solving various problems, but is distinct from others in that it focuses on knowledge representation and has proved to be useful for rapid prototyping. While the research on ASP has produced many promising results, it has also identified serious limitations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project aims at overcoming the limitations by merging ASP with other computing paradigms, such as satisfiability checking, first-order logic and constraint programming, and exploring the synergy between them. This project is expected to provide a transformative understanding of ASP&amp;apos;s relation to other computing paradigms, to enhance ASP&amp;apos;s reasoning capability and broaden the areas in which it is effective. Within knowledge representation, the study will clarify the role of ASP as a major knowledge representation formalism with effective computation methods that combines various methods available in other computing paradigms.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A number of scientific endeavors generate data that can be modeled as graphs: high-throughput biological experiments on protein interactions, high throughput screening of chemical compounds, social networks, ecological networks and food-webs, database schemas and ontologies. Access and analysis of the resulting annotated and probabilistic graphs are crucial for advancing the state of scientific research, accurate modeling and analysis of existing systems, and engineering of new systems. This project aims to develop a set of scalable querying and mining tools for graph databases by integrating techniques from databases and data mining. The proposed research work is theoretical as well as empirical. New theoretical ideas and algorithms are being developed and these are being applied to the domains of Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The first research thrust examines primitives for graph data management and graph mining. A declarative query language for graphs is being investigated. This language is based on a formal language for graphs and a graph algebra, and separates the concerns of specification and implementation. Scalability of techniques for similarity search on graphs and mining for significant patterns is being investigated as a part of this thrust.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The second research thrust applies the developed techniques to the domain of Cheminformatics. Specific tasks that are being examined are search for similar compounds, mining for significant motifs, diversity analysis, and analysis of macromolecular complexes.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The final research thrust applies the developed methods to the domain of Bioinformatics. There has been an explosion of data of widely diverse biological data types, arising from genome-wide characterization of transcriptional profiles, protein-protein interactions, genomic structure, genetic phenotype, gene interactions, gene expression, proteomics, and other techniques. Techniques being developed can integrate and analyze data from multiple sources and models efficiently, while accelerating (interaction and function) prediction, and pathway discovery.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Further information about the project can be found at the project web page http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~dbl/0917149.php.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The central mission of the THREDDS project is to make it possible for educators and researchers to publish, locate, analyze, and visualize in a wide variety of educational settings. In the initial phase THREDDS established a solid, working prototype of services and tools to enable data providers to create inventory catalogs of the data holdings at their site and educational module builders to author compound documents with embedded pointers to environmental datasets and analysis tools. These catalogs and data-interactive&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;documents can then be harvested into digital libraries using standard protocols. THREDDS Second Generation (THREDDS2G) is expanding the team of contributors and the breadth of data in the collections, taking advantage of recent technological advancements, and integrating THREDDS technologies with emerging standards and related environmental data systems. In addition it is actively engaging new disciplines and incorporating new tools that are making the end products more useful at all educational levels, for decision makers and for the general public. THREDDS2G significantly augments and expands the existing project as it breaks entirely new ground in several areas. The main objectives fall into the following categories:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. Interactive Educational Modules: work with the community of educational content builders and data providers to create educational modules that incorporate facilities for finding and interacting with environmental datasets.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Enhanced Metadata Catalogs: Using tools and inventory catalogs implemented in the initial phase, develop additional catalogs with significantly enhanced metadata to simplify the process of finding and using scientific data, developing standards and tools for enhanced metadata, incorporating scientific ontologies, and implementing scientific data models.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3. Interoperability with Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Create interoperable data systems with coherent connectivity and access to GIS data using GIS and traditional THREDDS clients.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;4. Dataset Search and Discovery and Other Web Services: Working collaboratively with NSDL and DLESE, ensure that THREDDS systems evolve toward compatibility with emerging standards in Web services.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;5. Education-oriented, Standards-based Client Software: Integrate an education-oriented GIS client analysis and display application called MyWorld to THREDDS data services.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;While THREDDS is a highly collaborative project, the Unidata Program Center is leading and coordinating the development, disseminating the software, and supporting the THREDDS community. With strong new partnerships that include leading organizations in K-12 educational technology, hydrology, solid Earth studies, societal impacts, and GIS, the impact of THREDDS2G will extend well beyond even the vast Unidata audience. Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences in recognition of the importance that this project has on the development of software tools for accessing, cataloging and analyzing content of environmental datasets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will develop a history of the notion a fundamental length in modern physics and it will explore the philosophical problems associated with that notion. The eventual aim is to produce an extended monograph. Currently, there is no comprehensive study of this notion. The proposed study will consider the diverse scientific and philosophical motivations for introducing this notion into modern physical theories this notion, including epistemic grounds for a finite spatial resolution or ontological grounds for spatial discreteness. The discussion will focus on the instantiations of this notion in the 20th century, and it will characterize and then analyze its philosophical and the phenomenological consequences of this notion, which are currently at the center of heated debates in the high energy physics community in struggling to unify the theories of relativity with quantum mechanics. The PI has already published two chapter-length journal articles on the subject, and aims to produce six more chapters for the monograph in a period of three years. These chapters will discus the history of the idea of fundamental length, the rationale for introducing it into modern theoretical physics, and both the methodological and philosophical problems this notion generates (particularly within quantum field theory and quantum gravity). &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project offers an outlook on the notion of fundamental length that spans two different research programs, namely the unification of quantum theory with each of the two theories of relativity. Based on written and oral sources, it builds on earlier historical studies of the notion of fundamental length in quantum field theory. It will draw methodological conclusions from the (partly-documented) historical episode, and applying them to the current attempts to construct quantum theories of gravity that introduce finite resolution or spatial discreteness. By combining the methodological analysis with an analysis of the philosophical issues that surround the notion of fundamental length, the project will bring to light some of the most pressing methodological problems in modern theoretical physics, first and foremost of which is the attempt to distinguish itself from pure mathematics at a time when empirical tests in the regimes it purports to describe are almost nonexistent.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to improve the quality of on-demand job matching by applying data mining and machine learning techniques to natural language descriptions of job requests, worker reviews, and transaction history. The project will enable lasting job matches by predicting the needs, preferences and constraints of workers and human resource managers. Currently available methods of job matching rely primarily on keyword search, corporate personality assessment tests, or fixed ontologies. Such systems lack comprehensive learning and therefore have difficulty matching workers with jobs. This project approaches job matching with a bias-free learning model that learns from hiring successes, trains on real-world data, and adapts to new job verticals.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project is a matching technology that optimizes workers&amp;apos; and employers&amp;apos; strengths, discovering matching opportunities overlooked by traditional search technologies. Online reputation-building through performance reviews can improve workers&amp;apos; ability to market themselves. The global matching technology permits nearly every skill to become marketable by matching workers with all features from every available job request. Natural language processing techniques, developed in the course of this project, have the potential to broaden the appeal of cell phone text-messaging as a comprehensive job-searching tool. Furthermore, the contextual approach to learning about workers and employers enables trends to be identified among users, and has far-reaching commercial implications in fields as diverse as medical research and e-commerce.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a novel Question Answering (QA) technology. The intellectual merits of the proposed activity are three fold: (1) it provides automatic decomposition of high level questions into logical, informative sets of fact-seeking questions, such that very complex questions can be automatically answered. This novel QA approach advances the state-of-the-art technology, which is currently limited to simple factual questions, enabling the answering of complex questions that model scenarios observed in actual customer environments. (2) It radically improves the accuracy of current state-of-the-art QA by using a logic prover to extract and justify answers. Language Computer Corporation (LLC) plans to develop an inference mechanism for question answering that is capable of extracting answers based on semantic inference chains, rather than on superficial keyword-based metrics. (3) It introduces a novel approach that adapts open-domain QA technology to domain-specific information using automatically acquired ontologies, seamlessly integrated with the system&amp;apos;s open-domain knowledge base. This capability provides a rapid and efficient customization method for various domains of interests, such as weapons of mass destruction.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact of the proffered technology is as follows: (1) the proposed approach allows QA technology to expand its capability, now restricted to synthetic evaluations based on simple, factual questions, to actual commercial applications with complex questions and scenarios. This places LLC in a position to target both government and commercial markets, where the accuracy, coverage, reliability and usability of the retrieved information are crucial. Ideal applications for this QA technology include homeland defense, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), education, medical, and legal. (2) The proposed model uses a logic proving mechanism that associates every extracted answer with a logical, easily understandable explanation of the answer correctness. Furthermore, LLC proposes the introduction of an automatic procedure to quickly adapt an open-domain QA system to domain-specific scenarios. This set of features makes this QA system an ideal tool for the intelligence business, where the quality of the information extracted is paramount, and where switching between completely different domains of interest is frequent.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this project is to build a domain-independent, language-independent, statistically-trained shallow semantic interpreter. This is a sophisticated, robust, widely-available tool that takes text sentences as input and provides a `shallow&amp;apos; representation of the meaning of the sentence. The research addresses key scientific questions including the nature of automatically-extractable linguistic features that link surface form with semantic structure, the extent to which features and representations are robust across languages, and the combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The shallow semantic interpreter works in both English and Chinese by analyzing sentences into propositions involving predicates together with their arguments, labeled by sets of semantic roles (Agent, Patient, Instrument, Location, etc). The project relies on a statistical machine-learning paradigm, including supervised approaches in which features are extracted from two large semantically-labeled databases (FrameNet and PropBank), as well as unsupervised and lightly-supervised methods like clustering with graphical models, co-training, and active learning, including various sophisticated linguistic features.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results of the project will allow shallow semantic representations to be incorporated into an entire range of key Natural Language Processing applications, including information extraction and machine translation. The research will also provide important knowledge about the linguistic features that are cues to meaning. Finally, the project will provide key publicly-available databases for other research. These include the combined FrameNet and PropBank database, which will be a rich resource for applications using the Semantic Web and ontologies in general, as well as a richly-annotated Chinese PropBank, and aligned English and Chinese corpora useful for machine translation research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The purpose of this project is to catalyze a new set of collaborations and initiate a partnership with project PIs Jason Bond (Auburn University), Marshal Hedin (San Diego State University), and Brent Hendrixson (Millsaps College) and Miquel Arnedo, at the University of Barcelona in Spain. The project-planning trip to the Barcelona will bring together a group of investigators who have interests in the evolution, systematics, conservation, and taxonomy of mygalomorph spiders. The spider infraorder Mygalomorphae (trapdoor spiders, tarantulas, and their kin), are a biologically unique clade of early diverging spiders; many of its members are well known to non-arachnologists and include the world&amp;apos;s largest (tarantulas), most venomous (Australian &amp;quot;funnel-web&amp;quot; spiders), and most long-lived spiders.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The planning trip will focus on reviewing the status of mygalomorph classification to identify &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; lineages, bring together all of the genetic data currently available with the aim of developing a more comprehensive set of molecular markers, develop a workflow for identifying a set of morphological character ontologies and a means by which to share morphological data, and formulate a general paradigm for evaluating species boundaries and conservation status. The planning trip will culminate in a 10-day collecting trip in the Andalusia region of Spain. In addition to developing a number of tangible outcomes to include a set of molecular markers for broad scale analyses of spider phylogeny, significant broader impacts of the project will involve training students (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) in conceptual issues related to systematics, biodiversity conservation and evolutionary biology.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will support a team of investigators who seek to resolve evolutionary relationships within the fungi. The research will enhance understanding of the ancient evolutionary diversification of the fungi by addressing evolutionary relationships among the major groups of fungi. This study will develop integrated molecular and morphological datasets, which will be freely accessible on the Web. Molecular data will include sequences from a target set of 76 genes that were identified from analyses of known fungal genomes. Morphological data will include characters associated with nuclear and cellular division and the morphological organization of hyphae. In addition the study will develop ontologies for morphological characters to promote further sampling and analytical integration across disparate organisms. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Fungi make up one of the major groups of life, with an estimated diversity of approximately 1.5 million species. These organisms play crucial ecological roles as decomposers, beneficial mutualists, and parasites and pathogens, including pathogens of humans. The economic significance of fungi is almost incalculable as they perform essential ecological functions and impact diverse applied disciplines, including agriculture, medicine, and drug discovery. A better understanding of the early evolutionary history of the Fungi is necessary to expand our knowledge of the history of life of Earth and the evolution of its ecosystems. Phylogenomic analyses and databases for fungi will transform the field of comparative fungal biology and will benefit all fields of fungal biology that rely on an accurate understanding of evolutionary relationships and diversity of Fungi. The bioinformatics tools for managing and analyzing phylogenomic data that will be developed will be broadly applicable across the Tree of Life. Training and outreach activities will include graduate and post-doctoral training, undergraduate training, and outreach to K-12 educators.</Abstract>

Combining the high computational performance of specialized circuits with the re-programmability of software, these devices are quickly becoming ubiquitous. Unfortunately, if unprotected, this reconfigurability could be exploited to disrupt critical operations, snoop on supposedly secure channels, or even to physically melt a device. However, a new approach to controlling changes to the hardware logic promises to overcome these problems. In addition, the innate malleability of this hardware presents the opportunity for hardware enforcement of adaptive security policies. For example, in an emergency, trusted individuals may need to override the nominal security policy. Thus, the reconfigurable component may provide a highly trusted mechanism for secure functionality in changing environments.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research aims to close a gaping security hole in our nation&amp;apos;s information infrastructure by enhancing the logical structure and internal management of reconfigurable hardware to enforce a dynamic information protection policy. Specifically, this research will: (1) discover hardware synthesis and static validation methods that will ensure that only secure and non-destructive configurations can be loaded, (2) develop new reconfigurable structures capable of securely mediating run-time access to shared resources through the use of hardware-compiled formal access policy languages, and (3) establish a firm foundation for trustworthy dynamic policy enforcement through ontological analysis, formal modeling and the development of management mechanisms integrating the results of the first two activities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The proposed dissertation project is will support the research of University of Wisconsin Madison graduate student Chelsea Chapman to investigate cultural conceptions of energy in order to understand how such conceptions inform local political discourse and conflict over fossil and renewable energy development. The researcher will apply ethnographic methods to the study of energy in Central Alaska where fossil and renewable resource production takes place in a culturally, historically, and environmentally complex social setting. Data will be collected through interviews, participant observation, and documentation of public commentary from regional energy industry workers, environmental organizers, Alaska Native community members, and renewable energy advocates. These folk conceptualizations of energy, energy production and use will be documented using categories based on occupational history and work experience, ethnicity and Alaska Native citizenship, and rural and urban residency. In addition, the project will focus on whether such conceptions of energy transcend these social categories of ethnicity, occupation, and residence as they become institutionalized as fields of distinct knowledge.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project links research conducted by the University of Western Cape&amp;apos;s (UWC) in South Africa with Howard University&amp;apos;s efforts in &amp;quot;Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Acquisition&amp;quot;. The highlight of this effort is that each year an investigator from Howard University and three graduate students from Howard University will travel to UWC to conduct research with UWC faculty and students. Their work will focus on the emerging intelligent-based internet computing - &amp;quot;The Semantic Web&amp;quot; with its evolving languages and ontologies. According to Fensel and Musen, &amp;quot;in a few years, it [the Web] will interweave one billion people and penetrate not just computers but also other devices, including cars, refrigerators, coffee machines, and even clothes.&amp;quot; The new millennium has ushered in the era of &amp;quot;intelligent knowledge engineering and management&amp;quot; (IKEM). &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; This project will have an immediate and long-range impact on several existing and proposed courses at both universities. Existing courses include Artificial Intelligence, Expert Systems, Computer Networks, Modeling and Simulation, Multimedia Systems, Systems Management, Large Scale Systems, and Web Services. Proposed courses include Advanced Intelligent Systems, and Human Computer Interaction. Advances in the development of an IKEM system will promote the utilization of digital libraries, semantic web services and real-time knowledge manipulation. Linking IKEM system development and utilization will provide a number of possibilities for extending this initial effort.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Abstract&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;0639164&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Scott Henninger - Univ Nebraska - Lincoln&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Title: An Ontology-Based Infrastructure for Creating Software Pattern Languages&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Software development is a knowledge intensive activity involving diverse technical and application domains. Software patterns, descriptions of recurring design problems coupled with proven solutions, have emerged as one means to systematically collect and disseminate software design knowledge. But as the number of available patterns proliferates, the expertise needed to find and effectively use patterns increases. Current pattern collections also contain no cross-references, missing important opportunities to capture and analyze interrelationships between knowledge embedded in patterns. The research objective is to investigate the efficacy of pattern &amp;quot;languages&amp;quot;, tightly coupled organizations of patterns supporting systematic development methodologies. Semantic Web technologies will be investigated to federate pattern collections into Web-based ontologies supporting semantic pattern relationships and computational reasoning. Research efforts will empirically investigate existing software pattern collections, develop proof-of-concept demonstrations of ontology-based pattern languages, and support collaborative creation and refinement of pattern languages. The significance of this research is to address essential and elusive difficulties of using patterns to achieve significant quality and productivity gains. In addition, semantic relationships between patterns will help organize and refine software development knowledge. Broader impacts include Web-based access to federated pattern languages, creating building blocks for future pattern language research, and using research results for pedagogical purposes.</Abstract>

<Abstract>9622991 MUHLY This is a request for travel support for junior investigators and graduate students to attend the conference, Aegean Conference in Operator Algebras and Applications, that is scheduled for the period, August 17, 1996, to August 27, 1996, at the University of the Aegean. With the advent of the theory of operator spaces, also known as &amp;quot;quantized functional analysis&amp;quot;, general, not-necessarily-self-adjoint, operator algebras have achieved an ontological status comparable to that held by the self-adjoint operator algebras. Although the non-self-adjoint theory is not yet as well developed, from certain perspectives, the explosion of results that has taken place in the last six years, or so, deserves to be exposed in a fashion that will allow the uninitiated, particularly younger scholars, easy access to the basics of the subject from the current perspective. The objective of the conference is to provide a series of short courses, that will be published, designed to provide an overview of the theory of non-self-adjoint operator algebras and its relation to other areas of operator algebra and modern analysis. The themes to be stressed are: non-self-adjoint operator algebras, general theory; concrete operator algebras, particularly reflexive algebras; multivariable operator theory and representations of function algebras; metric variations on themes from algebra - Hilbert and operator modules; operator spaces and their applications to Banach space theory and harmonic analysis; operator algebraic approaches to quantum groups; non-self-adjoint operator algebras and wavelets. The theory of non-self-adjoint operator algebras plays a central role in the mathematical underpinnings of a lot of mathematics applied to areas of national need. For example, in the area of signal processing, which is used to transmit data and images involved in all fields of science - from space observatories to tomographs of the brain - fundamental constructs, such as the so-calle d Toeplitz matrices and wavelet transforms, obtain their deepest significance and are most clearly revealed when viewed from the perspective of operator algebra. Operator algebra lays bare their basic algebraic properties (how they are manipulated in practice) and metric properties as well (how they are measured). In oil exploration, which involves wavelets and signal processing in a somewhat different fashion, operator algebraic methods, known as commutant lifting play a fundamental role. Also, in control theory, particularly in the design of aircraft and noise abaters, the mathematics involved is to a large extent operator algebra. The breakthrough that took place about six years ago, and alluded to above, enables the practitioner of this field to bring to bare effectively the full power of modern algebra to tackle the most basic and fundamental structural questions. The advances in this field have been very exciting and more are to come. But it is time collect a summary of what is known, including bibliographies, so that new people can enter this exciting, emerging field of research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Much AI work in planning uses deduction to draw conclusions about the future, so that the inferences work forwards in time from preconditions to consequences of actions. This project is developing an alternative approach in which the direction of reasoning is independent of temporal direction, so that information may have onsequences in the past or in the futre. It is based on an ontological framework of pieces of space-time with &amp;apos;natural&amp;apos; boundaries. The role of inference is also somewhat different; its purpose here is to provide an efficient source of explanations&amp;apos; for apparent anomalies in tentative partial plans. Planning - even if only of a simple kind - is of central importance in many AI applications, but has suffered from some stubborn theoretical difficulties; this lternative approach seems to provide a solution to the &amp;apos;frame problem&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;prediction problem&amp;apos;, both of which can be seen to arise from identifying temporal direction with direction of inference.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research objectives of this CAREER Award are to establish a foundation for a decision-based approach to product family design and develop metamodeling strategies for web-based product platform customization. The first objective will investigate methods for generating product platform alternatives and modeling the associated costs, demand, and uncertainties of the products within the corresponding product family derived from each platform alternative. The second research objective will enable rapid customization of platform variants via the Internet. The educational objectives in this CAREER Award will engage students in problem-based learning through industry-focused projects in product family design and customization and assess the effectiveness of the proposed educational activities at enhancing student learning and student&amp;apos;s attitudes toward lifelong learning. These educational objectives will be integrated within &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;three undergraduate courses and one graduate course. Product dissection activities to expose freshmen and women and minority students in grades K-12 to design and product families will also be developed. Three industrial partners -- Durametal, Flowserve, and Ivalo Lighting -- will collaborate in the proposed research and educational activities.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, the results of this research will help companies reduce development costs and time-to-market while increasing product variety and customization. Strategies for web-based platform customization will also enhance customer interaction and improve customer satisfaction. The proposed research will foster the development of design methods and tools that can be used to design families of products that meet a wide range of rapidly changing customer requirements. The educational activities will help prepare students to succeed in today&amp;apos;s highly competitive digital and global marketplace in which companies are constantly striving to shorten time-to-market and increase product variety while reducing costs. The research and educational activities will also establish a foundation for a long-term career in engineering design research and education.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project in linguistic theory is investigating the possibilities and problems of an explicit theory of linguistic syntax and semantics which operates on a single level of representation, with rules with strictly defined and restricted formal properties. The basic research focuses upon a set of interrelated issues in the areas of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The first set has to do with how information about syntactic dependencies determines surface order and (more generally) with characterizing the combinatorial possibilities available to natural language in formal and computational terms. The second set of issues concerns the representation of the syntactic dependencies that arise in natural language. The goals of the project with respect to semantics are to articulate the logical and ontological foundations of a theory which makes computational constructions out of mental entities.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the most significant and challenging software need in healthcare: Cohort identification. A cohort is a group of patients with a common medical condition. Cohorts underpin modern medical care, defining treatment algorithms, measuring quality improvement, supporting government initiatives, and representing the core organization for research trials. While manual techniques have been developed to identify a cohort within a healthcare organization&amp;apos;s electronic medical record (EMR), all rely on a physician or coder identifying and marking every record for every applicable medical condition. This manual process is inaccurate and only addresses the most common conditions. The suggested novel and revolutionary approach is to use big data techniques, utilizing the detailed unstructured narrative notes recorded on every patient for every encounter in every healthcare institution. The core technology required to extract and make unstructured data usable in healthcare is natural language processing (NLP) combined with coded representations of clinical concepts (ontologies). This proposal brings together industry leading teams and technologies to tackle the greatest data problem in healthcare, which offers a unique opportunity to significantly influence care for decades to come.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes creating the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of data-driven healthcare. Just as Google and Yahoo required advanced information extraction and search indexing techniques to make the vast amount of internet data usable, healthcare requires similar enabling technology. The healthcare challenge is even more complex given the multitude of natural language descriptions used by physicians and the complex logic that defines potential cohorts and algorithms. To address these issues, healthcare requires the category of technologies used in Google and Yahoo, but specialized for the healthcare domain. In healthcare, quality improvement requires recognizing at risk cohorts in a population. Missing these cohorts and inadequately treating them can increase mortality by an order of magnitude, as in the case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in acute care. For quality measures being implemented by the federal government, defining and identifying cohorts is always the first step of tracking and reporting. Current processes are manual, limited, and inaccurate. By bringing evidence derived from clinical documentation which is created in current workflow to real-time and population based treatment decisions, this intervention will form a foundation for data-driven care, supporting improved outcomes, shorter hospitalizations, and reduced direct medical costs.</Abstract>

<Abstract>A number of scientific endeavors are generating data that can be modeled as graphs: high-throughput biological experiments on protein interactions, high-throughput screening of chemical compounds, social networks, ecological networks and food webs, database schemas and ontologies. Mining and analysis of these annotated and probabilistic graphs is crucial for advancing the state of scientific research, accurate modeling and analysis of existing systems, and engineering of new systems. The goal of this research project is to develop a set of scalable querying and mining tools for graph databases by integrating techniques from the fields of databases, bioinformatics, machine learning, and algorithms. New algorithms are being developed, and these are being examined for their quality and running time on real datasets. The first set of algorithms addresses subgraph and similarity querying in graph databases. The second set considers the mining of significant subgraphs or motifs. A novel significance model which transforms graphs into histograms of primitive components and examines the significance of motifs in the transformed domain is being developed. The third set of algorithms targets the discovery of well-connected clusters in large probabilistic graphs. The project integrates research and education by introducing the results of the research into undergraduate and graduate courses. Robust open-source tools based on the developed algorithms will be released for other researchers. These will be helpful in the study of the structure and organization of large networks that are becoming increasingly common.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is expected to be the key enabling force in the emerging Service Web. The focus of this research project is a core issue in SOC and deals with trust management for Web services. The specific aim of this project is to develop novel techniques for defining, ascertaining, and managing the reputation of Web services as a key mechanism for implementing trust in delivering services. In this regard, a Peer-to-Peer approach is used to assess the reputation of a-priori unknown Web services. This approach relies on reputation metrics to efficiently select and compose services from a dynamic set of autonomous and disparate Web services. The approach uses local ontologies (communities) as a shared space for exchanging reputation information. A reputation evaluation metrics is incorporated into the Quality of Web Service to rate, change, and monitor the reputation of simple and composed Web services. The credibility of raters and potential malicious ratings are factored in to ensure accurate reputation assessment. Establishing a trusted environment for Web service interactions will facilitate and invigorate the deployment of applications such as E-commerce (e.g., B2B applications), E-government (e.g., social services), and E-science (e.g., Grid computing). Results from this research will be applied to an on-going e-government project that provides efficient and customized Web-based services to senior citizens. Research and coursework students are trained in this project through their involvement in short and longer term projects. The research results will be disseminated via the project Web site (www.eceg.cs.vt.edu/WS-reputation).</Abstract>

<Abstract>Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most widely used multipurpose database language. Extensive knowledge and fluency in SQL is mandatory in mastering modern database technologies. This project is developing an innovative tool that allows Information Science students to develop practical SQL skills through the use of interactive automatically evaluated exercises and examples. The PIs are leveraging the results of an NSF-supported project that uses interactive exercises for C language programming by exploring the value of interactive exercises in the context of Database courses. They are adapting an existing technology for automatic evaluation of SQL exercises (SQL-Tutor) developed at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand by Dr. Antonija Mitrovic and developing a complementary script-based evaluation technology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project is providing a complimentary set of interactive SQL examples for the original SQL-Tutor technology and enhancing it with personalized guidance that is known to increase student engagement and success rate. Achieving better engagement and success rate is essential to adapting the original SQL-Tutor technology to a different target audience that is less prepared and less motivated to work with interactive exercises. To explore the value of individualized exercises, examples, and personalization in the context of Database courses, the University of Pittsburgh also is running several formative and summative classroom studies.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Brittleness has been a resistant problem in articial intelligence, stymieing the search for robust automated systems - ones that do not break when confronted with even slight deviations from their intended domains and scenarios. Consequently, a solution to the brittleness problem will be a major step toward truly intelligent machines. This project is aimed at achieving this by means of a specialized module, the metacognitive loop (MCL). MCL is a monitoring-and-control module that can be attached to a given &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; system, thereby yielding an improved system. Successful implementations of several pilots of this module are being followed by a full-blown MCL.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research provides a specific methodology for building robust systems. Because MCL can potentially be added to any error-prone system and improve robustness across the board, its most significant mark will be felt by systems engineers who will be able to reduce the number of person hours spent writing error-handling code. This in turn will reduce the cost of developing new systems and impact a large number of domains, including everything from building robust robots to desktop operating systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Diffusion (or inference) geometries , provide tools for organization of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;massive digital data sets. Like differential calculus, they are used to&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;build global inference relations between objects by combining &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;``infinitesimal&amp;quot; (linear) models. Harmonic analysis on such structures&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;leads to multiscale folder building paradigms leading to powerful tools&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;for functional regression and analysis of massive complex data.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These geometric methods provide new insights in classical differential&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;geometry enabling explicit embedding theorems and coordinate systems for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Riemannian manifolds.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The multiscale analytic methods lead to a systematic analysis tool for&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;seemingly unstructured data bases, and enables the automatic generation&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;of Ontologies and data induced languages. These methods are broadly&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;applicable in medical diagnostics, in the organization and analysis of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;psychological questionnaires, as well as in all aspects of machine&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;learning from data mining to machine vision.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project on the foundations of quantum mechanics is supported by the Science, Technology, and Society program. It is also supported by the joint initiative with Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate: Research at the Interface of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Society. One goal of the project is to provide a critical scrutiny of one perspective on fundamental science so as to make way for an alternative. A widely prevalent image of science, which has influenced the thinking of many scientists and the general public, pictures scientific knowledge as hierarchically organized. At the base of the hierarchy is physics, applicable to objects and processes at all length and energy scales. The other sciences, which concern themselves with kinds of system (chemical, biological, psychological, social, economic) that become manifest only in special circumstances, are regarded as being based on &amp;quot;fundamental&amp;quot; physics.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The traditional hierarchy based on &amp;quot;fundamental&amp;quot; physics is organized in accordance with three principles: (1) Everything is composed of basic microphysical elements, (2) All properties of objects are wholly determined by the basic intrinsic properties and relations of these basic microphysical elements, and (3) All laws and/or theories governing the behavior of composite objects ultimately reduce to the fundamental laws/theories governing the behavior of their microphysical constituents. Taken together, these principles would warrant the belief that the basic laws that govern the behavior of the ultimate constituents of matter are in fact responsible for the behavior of everything. They provide an image of the physical world as constructed out of basic building blocks?basic objects, basic properties and basic laws. This research subjects each of these organizing principles of the traditional hierarchy to critical examination and explores ways of getting along without that hierarchy.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The current project builds on previous research undermining the principle that the properties of all objects are determined by those of their ultimate constituents. Physicists commonly talk of elementary particles and their associated quantum fields. But it turns out that there are strong reasons to doubt these could play the role of ultimate constituents of matter. Even if such objects were available to serve as building blocks, they do not compose the objects of condensed matter physics in any simple way. Though quantum (field) theories are extremely predictively successful, it has proved extraordinarily hard to interpret them as offering a self-contained description of the world at a fundamental level. If this is not possible, then the laws of fundamental physics as currently conceived cannot be responsible for the behavior of everything. This suggests a revised image of physics (if not all of science) as successfully modeling structures in various domains by a network of theories, loosely connected by diverse and domain-specific logical and ontological relations.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this project is to explore key algorithms, technologies and protocols that will lead to the next level of development of the original Semantic Web vision of the &amp;apos;Web of Data&amp;apos;, a Web in which the unstructured texts of the current Web are integrated in a seamless way with information currently locked in structured databases. While a huge amount of open data is being made available on the Web, especially in the &amp;apos;Open Government Data&amp;apos; arena, traditional computing techniques are inadequate for finding this data, for linking it to other data, and for reusing and repurposing the data resources. The project aims to show that an innovative combination of Semantic Web technologies will provide the basis for a new approach to large-scale, on-line, data integration and use.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research team will demonstrate our techniques by showing their efficacy on a combination of Open Government datasets being released around the world. There are already hundreds of thousands of these databases made available in machine-readable formats by countries, municipalities and cities, and the number is growing exponentially. This makes Open Government Data a large-scale testbed for Web-based data integration. The research team has collected the metadata for close to 400,000 datasets from more than 60 catalogs, from 20 countries, which are published in fourteen different languages. The project will show how the combination of linked-data representations, machine-readable metadata and Semantic Web ontologies will provide an ability to federate data across these catalogs, domains, and cultures. The researchers will develop the foundational algorithms that make it possible for researchers to find, access, integrate and analyze ad hoc combinations of these many datasets integrated on the fly. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Thus, the outcome of this project will be to demonstrate techniques, and develop a proof-of-concept demonstration, showing that the integration of multiple data sources across the Web can be accomplished by the application of a combination of semantic information of different kinds. The researchers will show that it is possible to build search and reuse tools that function across large distributed data collections, and we will explore the key research challenges in creating Web-scale linked-open-data repositories. The success of this project will demonstrate that by bridging the gap between structured and unstructured sources, it is possible to develop techniques that set the stage for a second generation of more powerful Semantic Web tools. Such tools will allow scientists, engineers, and eventually end users to perform a range of analyses without needing the large proprietary data resources currently available to only a small set of researchers working in companies with access to &amp;apos;big data&amp;apos;.

<Abstract>Since about the mid-1990s, animal welfare has been an increasing focus of farm animal science research in the US and the European Union, due in large part to public concern expressed over the treatment of farm animals. The US and EU governments are supporting multi-million dollar/euro programs that will play major roles in establishing national and international welfare standards. A complicating factor within farm animal science in both locations is the current lack of precise definition or measurement standards for welfare. This project will examine three programs (two under the US Department of Agriculture and one European Union-sponsored) that are all engaged, at varying levels, with a more recent research paradigm that attempts to measure animals&amp;apos; subjective (i.e., having awareness of their experiences) welfare, and will use a combination of qualitative methods that include textual analysis of program documents and published scientific research, and triangulation of data from interviews of key research personnel and observation at research sites. Three objectives guide this project&amp;apos;s design: 1) to compare the major characteristics of the US and EU research programs; 2) to examine in depth the manner in which knowledge of farm animals and their welfare is actively produced through the scientific spaces/settings, practices, and discourse of the programs and their published research; 3) to assess the implications for both the industry and for animal welfare of the varying research approaches identified within the US and EU programs. The project will develop data on the physical spaces/settings of the research and the experimental procedures, examining the data for relationships between particular spaces and practices and particular constructions of the animals&amp;apos; (subjective) welfare. With regard to discourse, the project will use narrative analysis broadly following a grounded theory approach to identify and understand epistemological and ontological approaches to farm animal welfare science, researcher conceptions of farm animals&amp;apos; capacities for awareness of experience and the resulting definitions of good/poor welfare, and the discursive representation of welfare concepts within and outside the scientific community. It is expected that the study will point to the types of changes (e.g., to farming spaces, practices, etc.) the scientific research results indicate, how the results respond to societal concerns about farm animal welfare, and how the US/EU research programs interact with and influence one another.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In comparing the US and EU research programs, this project will provide information about the ways in which welfare standards are determined in both locales. This information will be useful for policymakers and animal advocates in evaluating both these standards and the use and influence of public and private financial resources in responding to societal concerns about animal welfare. This project will also contribute to the understanding of the environments in which farm animal science takes place, the manner in which it is conducted, and the ways in which it is represented in scientific publications and beyond, thereby enhancing a critical understanding of the function of science in both animal agriculture and human-animal relations in Western society, and reflecting on the mutual influence between science and public opinion/policy. The outcome of the US and EU research has significant implications for many stakeholders ranging from institutions and corporations to the humans and animals whose lives are affected by their actions. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Advances in networks, sensors, storage, computing, and high throughput data acquisition, have led to a proliferation of autonomous, distributed data sources in many areas of human activity. New discoveries in biological, physical, and social sciences and engineering are being driven by our ability to discover, share, integrate and analyze disparate types of data. Statistically-based machine learning algorithms offer some of the most cost-effective approaches to discovery of experimentally testable predictive models and hypotheses from data. However, the large size, distributed nature, and autonomy of the data sources (and the attendant differences in access, queries allowed, processing capabilities, structure, organization, and underlying data models and data semantics) present hurdles to effective utilization of machine learning. This research aims to overcome these hurdles by developing efficient, resource-aware distributed algorithms and software services to support collaborative, integrative knowledge acquisition such a setting. The research team will implement, deploy, and evaluate the resulting algorithms using benchmark data sets, associated data models and ontologies, and user-specified inter-ontology mappings on a distributed test-bed of networked databases and services at Iowa State University and Kansas State University. The resulting open-source software can potentially transform collaborative e-science in the same way that Web has transformed information sharing. Broader impacts of this research include enhanced opportunities for research-based training of graduate and undergraduate students, interdisciplinary collaborations, participation of under-represented groups, and development of increasingly sophisticated software to support collaborative, integrative e-science. The project web site (http://www.cild.iastate.edu/projects/indus.html) provides access to information about the project, benchmark data, publications, software, and documentation.</Abstract>

<Abstract>We live in the information age, a time when data and knowledge is plentiful and easily moved, processed and mined by machines. This makes it easier to discover knowledge and more efficiently manage our affairs but also increases concerns about information confidentiality, privacy and trust. Balancing these will be a defining challenge in the coming decades and is particularly urgent today in organizations responsible for national defense, law enforcement, emergency services, and public health and safety. The 9/11 Commission addressed this in their report and called for &amp;quot;a paradigm change from Need to Know to Need to Share&amp;quot;. This project will explore one concrete aspect of this shift -- how executable policies can help organizations enhance their ability to share information and access while still maintaining appropriate levels of security, confidentiality and privacy.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the University of Texas at San Antonio and the University of Texas at Dallas will build on existing work at our three institutions to develop and refine a a conceptual framework for computational policies to support information sharing in a need to share environment. Our framework will integrate and extend our work on access control (RBAC), usage control (UCON) and deontic policies (REI), grounding them in ontologies expressed in the Semantic Web language OWL. We will use it to design a policy specification language and enumerate required software artifacts and tools. Finally, we will study the framework applicability to realistic applications such as the management of healthcare records and homeland security related data.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of Massachusetts Amherst is awarded a grant to develop a shared digital resource collection of finite element models of biological systems. Finite element analysis (FEA) is a computer-based technique for predicting the physical behavior of engineered products based on fundamental principles of mechanics. FEA has revolutionized engineering by allowing the design and optimization of high quality, complex products to occur completely within a digital environment. Now biologists are beginning to use FEA to understand the biomechanical behavior of biological organs, tissues and even cells. FEA has the ability to transform the way that biologists approach problems in areas ranging from functional morphology to paleobiology, developmental biology and cellular mechanics. In addition to finite element models, this resource collection will include an integrated set of web-enabled ontologies for sharing finite element modeling metadata, knowledge and mechanical property values of biological materials, interactive software tools for visualizing FEA models and results, FEA utilities supporting the development of biological finite element models, and a threaded discussion. On a broader scale, this project will capitalize on the visual appeal of FEA to inform the public&amp;apos;s perception and understanding of the fundamental integration of biological and engineering sciences. This will be accomplished by developing fresh and exciting educational resources for use in the K-12 classroom and by contributing to college-level courses that use computational tools to teach abstract biological concepts.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The University of California at Santa Barbara is awarded a grant to address semantic data heterogeneity in ecology by developing and deploying innovative software services that use ontologies and automated reasoning. Ontology-based searches will allow scientists to find data using familiar and meaningful scientific terms, but with better precision and recall than is possible with text-based searches available today. The Morpho and Metacat data-management tools, initially developed by the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity, will be extended to support semantic annotations, semantic queries, and sensible data summarization. These tools will provide an open, interoperable semantic software framework. The broader ecological and informatics community will contribute use cases, usability requirements, and feedback on the proposed additions through workshops at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the Long Term Ecological Research Network. Improving and extending the Morpho and Metacat software systems will benefit the hundreds of ecological field stations in the US and abroad that currently utilize this software for data archiving and discovery. These new semantic software capabilities and improved usability of existing tools will result in more scalable and efficient data synthesis, thereby allowing scientists, students, and educators to better understand and manage complex systems and human-induced global problems. The project will be a collaborative effort with the University of California at Davis.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Professor Fine is examining issues relating to the general topics of theories, explanation and interpretation--issues central to our understanding of how science develops--as they arise in the context of quantum theory. The studies will examine how these topics are conceptualized in the quantum domain by examining the different conceptions employed in treating a number of concrete philosophical and scientific problems there. The object is to get a profile of the conceptions in the context of reflexive scientific practice, so as to further our understandings of the concepts and of that practice. The background for the studies is the movement toward a more piecemeal approach in the philosophy of science. In particular, these studies should help assess the orientation developed by Professor Fine (which he calls &amp;quot;the natural ontological attitude&amp;quot;); for that assessment requires a repertoire of detailed context-sensitive studies as a basis for reasoned judgments regarding the prospects and limitations of this approach to science.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The focus of this research is the development of formal methods of nonmonotonic reasoning to express commonsense knowledge and reasoning. Additional epistemological problems will be investigated, including formalization of the notions of context and mental situation. It is intended that this work will make it possible to develop a general purpose database of commonsense facts. Work will also proceed on the formal expression of heuristics. Specific topics include introspective circumscription, the ramification problem, the description of creating and destroying objects in the situation calculus, and ontologies of time and action.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project examines an area largely overlooked in the literature on genocide by focusing on two questions. What is the psychology underlying the early detection and comprehension of the threat of genocide? What factors facilitate the refusal to be victimized and the drive to protect oneself and family? The Principal Investigator examines the psychology underlying the resistance to genocide through a narrative analysis of interviews with German Jewish exiles who fled the Third Reich before the Holocaust. The work addresses five important substantive questions. (1) What is the relationship between cognition, ontological security and ethnic violence? (2) Are basic personality factors more important than contextual or situational influences in an individual&amp;apos;s ability to withstand the psychology of victimization that accompanies genocide? (3) How social is the construction of identity, and how is our ethical-political action in turn shaped by our perceptions of others? (4) Was there something particularly virulent in German anti-Semitism, or can the kind of ethnic violence that occurred during the Holocaust occur elsewhere, given similar background conditions and social-psychological factors? And finally (5) can work on identity help formulate a theory of moral action that subsumes rational actor theory by encompassing that theory into a broader theory of human flourishing?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Why is this research appropriate for a SGER? The work meets 4 requirements for a SGER: urgency of data collection, dissemination of raw data, exploration of innovative research methodologies, and applying new approaches to an established research topic. (1) Urgency of data collection. There is an urgent need to collect raw data from this particular group of people, before their memories are lost because of death or health problems as a result of aging. Despite extensive work on the Holocaust, this sample represents one group that has rarely been interviewed, yet the investigator&amp;apos;s few preliminary interviews suggest they provide unusual insight on this period. (2) Dissemination of raw data. The investigator&amp;apos;s work on cognitive frameworks has broken new ground in our understanding of how identity and perceptions of self constrain choice. Detecting the subtleties of this process requires a particular skill and access to subjects. By publishing the full interviews, the investigator will be releasing valuable data to the social science community, thereby providing access to an unusually rich data source so others can perform the kind of technical analyses no one scholar can have either the time or skills to execute. (3) Exploration of innovative research methodology. Mixing survey with narrative and interpretive data is innovative. This methodology is highly promising and congenial to improvements in interviewing in ways that might reconcile important methodological and ethical issues concerning interviewing on sensitive topics, such as genocide and racism. (4) Application of new expertise or new approaches to an established research topic. Knowledge about individuals whose identities were threatened, in multiple ways, and yet who managed to flourish, personally and professionally, can yield important insights.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This investigation promises to enhance substantially our understanding of this topic and provide a valuable database for other scholars.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The rapid information flow from the experiments being constructed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the European Laboratory for High Energy Physics (CERN), Geneva presents a major computational challenge. In this ITR proposal, the UW-Madison team proposes to design and build a prototype Rapid-Response Adaptive Computing Environment (RACE) that integrates their local resources with the globally distributed computing grid, to cater to mission-critical, time-bound needs of the CMS experiment. These RACEs will have resource management features as well as knowledge management features. The UW team proposes to develop RACE technology by focusing on CMS trigger system data validation and data forensics software. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This work can empower individual physicists and small groups enabling efficient, reliable, tractable and timely extraction of LHC physics. In addition, they propose to help adapt the RACE set-up to the needs of the UW Medical Physics researchers who expect to exploit commodity computers for providing burst computing for their online radiation therapy applications. The team anticipates that the software infrastructure that they develop for knowledge management can be applied to other domains by developing appropriate ontologies and descriptions using the same overall principles. The graduate research assistants working on this project will benefit from applying their research ideas to a concrete real-world application. The cross-fertilization of ideas from their interdisciplinary team should enhance their ability to come up with innovative ideas when they move on to work in the industry.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will extend the state of the art in high performance multilingual information access, both in terms of underlying science and its technological realization via a functional prototype for English and German in the biomedical domain. Heretofore, Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) was founded upon dictionary-based query translation methods or corpus-based statistical learning of vocabulary mappings, combined with various IR methods. The existence of large, well accepted ontological resources in biomedicine (e.g., MeSH and UMLS) enables a new interlingual approach wherein both queries and documents are mapped into multiple taxonomic categories automatically, permitting direct conceptual matching. This research will compare existing techniques (dictionarybased and corpus-based) with the new interlingual methods on various evaluative dimensions, such as I I-point average precision, computational tractability, and end-to-end user acceptability. To judge the latter, a full prototype system will be developed; that is the main focus of the European side of the project. In addition to developing and evaluating these new CLIR methods, and producing and evaluating a usable prototype application, this project will provide other benefits beyond CLIR proper improving IR precision via automated corpus-based word sense disambiguation; developing statistical methods for the creation of multilingual lexical and phrasal resources; providing automated on-demand summarization of retrieved documents using the Maximal Marginal Relevance method; and improving multilingual information access and management systems forthe biomedical domain.</Abstract>

<Abstract>SES 99-06565 - Charles R. Twardy (Indiana University)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Causal Modeling, Causal Inference, and Causal Perception&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Under the auspices of this grant, the Principal Investigator will conduct a two-year training and research fellowship at Monash University (Clayton, Victoria, Australia) to learn the techniques of Bayesian network modeling so that he can extend his investigations into causality, causal inference, and scientific methodology.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Principal Investigator will employ Bayesian network models to represent human cognition in the context of argument generation and analysis, and to model how humans learn causal networks (including deviations from theoretically normative inference). He will then analyze the implications of this work for causal perception, causal judgment and causal reasoning in scientific inquiry. Bayesian network models are a unified and more powerful alternative to several mainstream analyses of causation: they naturally accommodate complex causal interactions and progressive causal inference. This proposal seeks to extend the domain of these models to provide a method for more thoroughly testing or analyzing human causal induction than has been available in the philosophical or psychological literature.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The leading account of causality in the philosophy of science, CQ theory, may be able to provide an ontological solution to Hume&amp;apos;s problem, but it does not deal with Hume&amp;apos;s profound worries about human causal induction. Bayesian theory is one of the leading methods of dealing with inductive inference, and Bayesian networks are being employed specifically to represent causal networks. The Principal Investigator proposes to combine causal insights from Bayesian modeling theory, cognitive psychology, and the philosophy of science to provide a unified theory of human causal inference. This proposal involves training the Principal Investigator in the methods of Bayesian network modeling, and then applying Bayesian models in ways analogous to the work the Principal Investigator recently completed to combine psychological and philosophical accounts of causal perception and causal judgment. This will provide the Principal Investigator with the solid technical foundation for continuing philosophical inquiry in causation and methods of scientific discovery.</Abstract>

<Abstract>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mark Liberman and Dr. Steven Bird will lead a team conducting three years of research on data models and query languages for linguistic databases. The project will develop relational and XML data models for linguistic databases combining annotated recordings, comparative wordlists, data tabulations, interlinear texts, syntactic trees, ontologies of descriptive terms, and links between all these types. High-level user interfaces will support query-by-example and online analytical processing, permitting linguists to select appropriate language data, integrate data from multiple sources, transform the structure of the data, add new annotations in collaboration with others, and convert it all to suitable formats for archiving and for use in research and teaching.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Describing and analyzing human languages depends on being able to manage large databases of annotated text and recorded speech. The size and complexity of these databases promises to bring unprecedented depth and breadth to empirical linguistic research. However, this promise will not be fulfilled until language scientists can readily access and manipulate the data. This project will apply recent research in databases to linguistics, develop a linguistic query language, and deploy it in a variety of open-source tools for creating, managing, analyzing, and displaying annotated linguistic databases. By making rich data re-usable, the research will open the way to a deeper and broader understanding of the world&amp;apos;s languages.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The REU Site, Mathematical Sciences at Ursinus College: A Broad Spectrum of Opportunities, will be a vibrant community of scholars with students as integral members, and will focus on exposing students to opportunities in numerous subfields of the mathematical sciences. Exposure to questions, concepts, and viewpoints from multiple fields has inspired new, deep and interesting theorems, theories and algorithms. The PIs and senior personnel are active researchers in diverse fields in the mathematical sciences ranging from pure mathematics (analysis, operator theory) to applied mathematics (mathematical modeling, differential equations) to computer science (information retrieval, high performance computing). The REU includes the use of cross-project discussion to advance knowledge across different fields in the mathematical sciences with a focus on engaging undergraduates in serious research. The REU activities have been conceived and organized so that participants will have transformative learning experiences on- and off-campus, and will work in an environment that fosters interaction. The program goals are to nurture undergraduates? interest and skills in research, improve their ability to utilize complex constructions and analyze complex issues, and provide them with the mathematical sophistication required for successful research careers in the mathematical sciences. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Students from diverse backgrounds will be recruited nationwide, and will interact with each other and with experienced faculty. Students will spend eight weeks devoted exclusively to working in teams on original research in the mathematical sciences under the close tutelage of a faculty mentor. The REU will require weekly visible products, presentations at regional and national conferences, preparation of papers for submission to research journals, attendance at sessions on post-graduate opportunities, and visits to other REU sites. The REU students will network and develop professional relationships with the larger mathematical sciences community by participating in a number of off-campus professional events. Participants will be seamlessly integrated into the existing Ursinus Summer Fellows research program which will expose the students to scholarly investigations in a wide range of fields. The REU places a special emphasis on recruiting students who would not otherwise have an opportunity to participate in a research project. Ursinus College is one of the more diverse campuses among highly selective liberal arts colleges, and the PI has a record of, as well as a commitment to, involving students from underrepresented groups on research projects.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this project is to provide a political analysis of the legal pluralism in the context of state-society relations and human rights through the lenses of religious personal status laws (i.e. marriage, divorce, inheritance, succession etc.) in Israel, Egypt and India. The study explains why nation-states recognize and incorporate non-state normative orders (customary and religious personal laws) into their unified body of law. In addition, the researchers assess the implications of this incorporation upon the capacities of central state administrations and individual freedoms and rights of citizens in post-colonial societies. As opposed to many, who assert that polycentric legal orders in the field of personal status laws are due to the colonial legacies of European empires, the researchers hypothesize that most post-colonial nation-states make their decisions whether to recognize and incorporate non-state normative orders based on rational cost-benefit calculations. The project has far-reaching theoretical and practical implications on the field of law and society. It primarily serves the aim of furthering our understanding of legal pluralism and contributes to the literature by providing ontological and epistemological innovations, such as introducing an alternative new institutionalist approach to the existing colonial legacy theories and suggesting a new terminology and nomenclature. Since it is a doctoral dissertation, the project blends the scientific endeavor and higher goals of education in its nature with a multidisciplinary approach derived from political science, law, anthropology and sociology. The main contention of the work is that legal pluralism in the field of religious personal status laws infringe upon the rights of women, political dissidents and seculars. Hence, by the dissemination of research findings, the study contributes to a better understanding of freedom of conscience and religion, and emancipation of women, and under-represented groups from patriarchal and religious oppression in Israel, India and Egypt.</Abstract>

<Abstract>9306751 Lifschitz The goal of this research is to develop and study high-level declarative languages designed specifically for describing action and change. The available methods for representing properties of actions in logic will be characterized as translations from high- level languages into monotonic or nonmonotonic logic-based formalisms. The claims that these methods are adequate will be stated as soundness or completeness properties of the corresponding translations, and the validity of these claims will be investigated. Methods for describing nondeterministic actions will be developed, and their adequacy will be investigated in a similar way. Competing methods (using different ontologies of action or different nonmonotonic logics) will be compared by studying the high-level languages to which they are applicable. Translation of high-level action languages into traditional programming languages will also be studied. This will allow the application of software tools developed for program verification to the automation of some forms of common sense reasoning.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on a novel approach to develop units-based numeric indexing and search tools. The goal is to extract numeric quantities from technical literature, identify each with a corresponding physical unit, and further relate these to other identified semantic entities such as device properties. Unlike generic semantic information extraction strategies, which attempt to identify ambiguous structure with AI learning algorithms, Entanglement Technologies? solution capitalizes on the standardization and universality of units. Physical quantities are identified accurately with scientific heuristics in knowledge-rich contexts, and thus numeric search can be more efficient than keyword searches. The research objectives are to design and optimize these scientific heuristics across a wide array of physical units to intelligently extract numeric data. Concurrently, Entanglement will develop detailed scientific ontologies for identifying the context of an indexed number-unit pair. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Successful demonstration of this project offers the potential for rapid and accurate data mining for technical and scientific specifications. This will have broad applications in industrial and scientific research. Entanglement Technologies anticipates generating licensing revenue from access to this search technology, targeting financial institutions involved in high-tech investments and academic libraries providing scientific search capabilities. The ability to define comprehensive, yet objective, heuristics for contextualizing a number removes much of the user&amp;apos;s responsibility for identifying the correctness of the search engine?s retrieval. This inherent feature provides a non-expert with the capability for searching, aggregating and analyzing technical data currently only processed by experts. Furthermore, units-based numeric search offers the potential for automated number extraction and aggregation. Entanglement will utilize this capability by integrating its search functionality into a front-end user-friendly package, allowing a customer to benefit not only from the search but also from streamlined graph and report generation. If successful, this potential for automation will reduce the cost of such services currently provided by technical consulting firms.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal is to develop the PI&amp;apos;s ongoing investigation into non-trivial examples of pluralism in the foundations of mathematics involving seemingly incompatible but viable approaches. Two main loci of such multiplicity are (1) the choice between classical and constructive logic (renouncing certain classical principles) in the formulation of analysis, differential geometry, etc., and (2) differing ontological frameworks as in the single fixed universe of set theory as contrasted with the multiple universe approach of category theory (CT) and related varieties of structuralism. Of particular interest under (1) is &amp;quot;smooth infinitesimal analysis&amp;quot; (SIA) which develops a non-punctiform conception of the continuum, with infinitesimals whose square is 0. Constructive logic must be used to avoid inconsistency, but the results are striking simplifications of classical analysis and a vindication of early proofs in calculus, long thought to be discredited. Problems of interpretation, however, arise due to the banning of certain classical inferences involving identity. Whether such apparent conflicts are genuine or merely apparent, and, in the latter case, how reconciliation is to be achieved, are important questions that this project will address and try to resolve. Concerning (2), although set theory with a fixed universe is traditionally taken as the background framework for developing mathematical theories, category theory&amp;apos;s claims to provide an alternative, more general and adaptable framework deserve serious attention.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project seeks to clarify the status of CT as an autonomous alternative, as well as its relation to other structuralist approaches (e.g. the PI&amp;apos;s modal-structuralism) that, like CT, also provide for &amp;quot;multiple universes&amp;quot; of mathematical discourse. Progress on these questions can help shape the general understanding of the nature of mathematics as well as its relation to other sciences, which exhibit analogous kinds of &amp;quot;pluralism.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Concerning the broader impacts of this research, it should promote a conception of mathematics as a much more multi-faceted body of knowledge than is widely thought, both among scientists and the public. This can be reflected in mathematical education in a wide variety of contexts, most immediately at the college level. The PI&amp;apos;s work illustrates the importance of tolerating, and even promoting, a multiplicity of seemingly conflicting approaches, which are not only useful but may even be necessary for comprehending a rich and complex subject matter. At the same time, as the particular mathematical theories focused on here well illustrate, there need be no sacrifice of rigor or other relevant intellectual standards in the pursuit of these multiple approaches. This project can help promote tolerance of pluralism, while maintaining appropriate standards of logic and evidence, in a wide variety of contexts, within and beyond the academic.</Abstract>

<Abstract>There are potentially valuable nuggets of information hidden in document collections generated by multiple authors, working independently at various times. Such information is not explicit, but can be inferred by following chains of concepts and associations. Users surfing the web may need to be monitored with the goal of deriving their true information need, which could be motivated by malicious intent. The problem of unintended information revelation (UIR) is a special case of text mining where the documents represent some pre-selected subset of interest to a user, generated through purposeful querying or surfing. The goal is to quantify the information revealed by this subset and to detect significant chains of concepts and associations. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This effort focuses on the development of a UIR framework and toolkit that covers the following areas: (i) probabilistic frameworks for concept chain graphs (CCG): a new information representation conducive to text mining; (ii) automatic construction of CCGs from representative document collections using pre-existing ontologies and machine learning techniques in information extraction; (iii) discovery tools that quantify information revealed and reveal hidden, information rich paths within the CCG, and (iv) interactive visualization tools for the CCG. This new framework facilitates better visualization and analysis of information than existing information retrieval (IR) representations. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project should impact several applications, most notably homeland defense applications. The UIR toolkit has the potential to expose sensitive information available on unclassified websites. It can also be used to ascertain whether that information is benign or safe to disseminate. Applications in discovery from scientific documents are also enabled.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The objective of this workshop is to allow scientists to reach a mutual understanding of the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;needs of microbial research, to understand how these needs can be addressed through an&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;improved data management infrastructure, and to provide a roadmap for implementation of such an infrastructure. The workshop will facilitate the understanding of the available data management and knowledge extraction technology, the future direction of this field, and how it can be used to advance microbial research. Recent advances in the life sciences have resulted in an increasing amount of scientific data. This valuable data has been stored in separate databases. However, there are no efficient mechanisms that allow scientists to issue complex queries including multidatabase queries. Yet such mechanisms would considerably improve the rate at which scientists process and analyze the data compressing the cycle from investigation to discovery. This workshop will bring together scientists who are impacted by the emergence of these numerous databases, since they use these databases on a regular basis to advance microbial research. In addition, the workshop will include a number of researchers in information technology with interests in databases and information retrieval. The workshop will feature speakers from academia, industry and research centers. Some of the speakers will present their experience in maintaining microorganism databases such as the TIGR Comprehensive Microbial Resource. Other speakers will focus on the state of the art in database management and information retrieval issues including database integration, ontologies and semantic web technology. Furthermore, the workshop will include speakers with interests in microbial research that relies on microorganism databases.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The workshop will expose database researchers to the challenges of microbial research and encourage them to use these challenges as real life study cases when developing new data management systems. The workshop will provide a forum for an exchange of ideas from scientists and researchers with different backgrounds. The outcome of the workshop will be a data management infrastructure implementation plan of importance to the entire field of microbial biology.</Abstract>

This project examines the importance of intermediate physical organizations in the transformation of loose networks of researchers into sustainable cyber-based virtual organizations in emerging fields of interdisciplinary science and engineering work. Unlike much previous research, this project specifically investigates the emergence of virtual organizations that did not emanate from major existing physical organizations. Critical case studies of networks and organizations within Engineering Education Research will be studied from a symbolic interactionist perspective to understand precursors, pivotal moments, and the growth and strengthening of relationships amongst their members. Social/organizational network analysis and oral histories will be used to develop an understanding of the evolution and success of loose networks and virtual organizations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Investigating the emergence of new virtual organizations is a crucial step in learning how to identify, catalyze and provide the cyberinfrastructure required to support the nascent teams that will be central to future advances in science and engineering. This will be helpful to funding agencies, and other public and private research institutions. Research in the evolution and emergence of new interdisciplinary communities and virtual organization focused on discovery and learning can help eliminate potential barriers to access and enable increased participation by underrepresented groups.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goals of this five-year project are (1) to improve the learning of physics and physical science teachers and students in grades 5-12 by developing a science teacher education model focused on the establishment of a diagnostic learning environment through formative assessment as a powerful instructional practice for promoting learning of all students on the topic of energy; and (2) to increase the understanding of the processes through which teachers develop the requisite knowledge, skills, and dispositions for effective deployment of a formative assessment instructional cycle. Its three specific objectives are: (1) to produce research-based diagnostic tools on energy in the context of physics and physical science; (2) to develop research instruments to probe teachers&amp;apos; understanding of content, students&amp;apos; ideas, and instructional responses to formative student data; and (3) to document case studies of teachers&amp;apos; formative assessment practices in the classroom in order to identify the components of, and obstacles to effective practice. Major activities of the proposed model-development process will center on: (a) Identifying pre-college students&amp;apos; and teachers&amp;apos; modes of reasoning on energy; (b) developing and implementing research-based internet diagnostic tools that provide real-time information to teachers to advance instruction; (c) developing tasks to probe (i) teachers&amp;apos; knowledge of common student thinking in energy, (ii) teachers&amp;apos; skills in selecting appropriate strategies for diagnosing the students&amp;apos; ideas, (iii) teachers&amp;apos; skills in selecting effective instructional practices based on diagnosed students&amp;apos; thinking; and (d) characterizing teachers&amp;apos; development toward the use of formative assessment through the study of teachers&amp;apos; real practices.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Scientists and supporters of science have long worked to improve the sharing, reuse, storage, and retrieval of scientific data. Today, efforts focus on advanced &amp;quot;cyberinfrastructure&amp;quot;: using networked computers, databases, and organizations to bridge divides among diverse scientific disciplines. Cyberinfrastructure divides into three main activities. First, large numbers of automatic sensors monitor subjects of interest, such as ecosystems and Earth&amp;apos;s climate, producing massive volumes of digitized data. Second, in many fields computer models have replaced laboratory experiments as the principal means of data collection, prediction, and decision-making. Third, increasingly vast data resources (scientific memory) are now available, but are often distributed across thousands of research sites and institutions, in numerous incompatible formats. For cyberinfrastructure-enabled science to deliver on its transformative potential, cyberinfrastructure designers need better ways of understanding how scientists actually create and share data in practice, and how they use it to create new knowledge. To investigate data practices empirically, this project examines four large cyberinfrastructure efforts: the Long Term Ecological Research Network, the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, the WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network, and the Earth System Modeling Framework. In each case, the investigators will study how cyberinfrastructure is used in monitoring, modeling, and memory. These projects spread across many disciplines addressing three important domains, all related to climate change concerns: ecology and environment; hydrology and water management; and earth system science. In conducting the project, the investigators will develop innovative methods of distributed ethnography, collaborative history, and multimodal network analysis. In addition to published findings, the project will produce a &amp;apos;best practices&amp;apos; handbook meant to guide data practices and coordination in cyberinfrastructure. The project will partner with organizations working to enhance the role of women in computing; to build database systems for American Indian communities; and to engage other groups often ignored in information infrastructure development. The project will thus lay groundwork for an inclusive, theoretically rich, and practically engaged social science of cyberinfrastructure.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This proposal develops the curriculum and laboratory facilities that are required to train the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;students of the three participating colleges (Clark Atlanta, Spelman and Morehouse) in the area of Information Assurance and Security.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This plan:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) Builds the core curriculum and create necessary laboratory facilities for student education and&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;training in the area of IAS including three core courses and a laboratory course). The CIS department at Clark Atlanta University will offer two courses. The CS department at Spelman College will offer one course. The CS department at Morehouse College will enhance some of its existing courses to include IAS related topics. Students from Georgia Tech, CAU, Spelman, and Morehouse colleges can take courses from any of the four colleges, through the University system in Georgia, without incurring any additional charges.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) Creates three computer laboratories, one at each of the participating, with the required facilities for student training in the area of Information Assurance and Security. The laboratories will be equipped with a network of computing systems and students will be able to experiment with the security related software in a controlled environment. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The impact of the proposed program includes:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) Enhanced curriculum, laboratory facilities and research activities in the area of IAS in all the three participating colleges.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) More opportunities for CS students of CAU, Spelman College, Morehouse College and Georgia Tech to register for IAS related courses.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) Increased awareness of information security related issues in the community.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The results are measured using evaluations from students, professors and faculty members outside the consortium with expertise in the area of curriculum development. We anticipate that the students who graduate from the three colleges with concentration in IAS will pursue higher studies at other Universities or take up jobs as security professionals.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Fault tolerant protocols are essential for providing various services (routing, group communication, broadcasting, multi-casting, etc.) in large, dynamic, distributed systems, where both processors and communication links can malfunction intermittently. For example, in mobile and ad hoc networks, the communication links are unreliable and some nodes may be unreachable for certain amounts of time. Such networks, consisting of mobile hosts that communicate via wireless radio channels, are being increasingly used for local area networks, law enforcement, military operations and a myriad of other applications. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The traditional approach in designing fault tolerant protocols assumes an upper bound on the number of faults and involves a worst case design by fault masking. While this approach&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;provides 100% system availability under assumed conditions, the implementation becomes very expensive. At the same time there are numerous applications for which the lack of system availability for very short periods is acceptable. Self-stabilization is an ``optimistic&amp;apos;&amp;apos; model to design &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;distributed fault tolerant systems; no upper bound on the number of faults is necessary, systems always reach a legitimate global state starting from any arbitrary (possibly illegitimate) state, and no central control is needed. However, system availability is not guaranteed during the convergence period.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This research addresses the design and analysis of fault tolerant self-stabilizing protocols for global communication primitives for dynamic distributed systems, especially suitable for mobile ad hoc networks. The research focuses on several aspects:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-- Create paradigms and guiding principles for designing self-stabilizing distributed algorithms;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-- Explore methodologies for translating a conventional algorithm into a self-stabilizing analog;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-- Discover and analyze self-stabilizing protocols for global communication primitives (resource center location, leader election, etc.) in a network;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-- Explore fractional (rational) valued self-stabilizing algorithms as a way to obtain improved approximate solutions to otherwise NP-hard problems;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;-- Measure the degree to which self-stabilizing algorithms can contain a single fault.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The research takes a combined theoretical and experimental approach, and applies its results to emerging distributed applications for ad hoc networks.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this project is to address the problem of accessibility and preservation of research data. Today, the responsibility for most scientific data rests on individual researchers who typically do not have the means for long-term preservation of or access to their data. As a consequence, scientific data all too frequently are not available for comparative analysis and may become lost altogether due to funding changes, personnel turnover, and physical deterioration. Research universities, however, already rely on the library to provide institutional support for archiving, access, metadata, and outreach services for print and digital collections. This project will examine the opportunities for partnership between the research community and the library to ensure that research data are collected, preserved, and accessible to research communities. The project will focus on language acquisition data that have been collected by the Cornell Language Acquisition Laboratory (CLAL) over twenty years and across more than twenty languages and countries. The project will develop and document the principles of access, dissemination, and data preservation; develop and document a prototype for testing and demonstration; and examine possible protocols for inter-institutional library cooperation. The project will also assess both start-up and ongoing costs required for this planned infrastructure to facilitate extending the model to other research institutions and libraries. The project will have broad impact by exploring a new approach to long-term storage, preservation, access, and dissemination of scientific data which may be applicable to many disciplines.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The goal of this collaborative research project (0414981, W. Meng, SUNY Binghamton and 0414939, C. Yu, UIC) is to develop technologies for providing integrated access to Web databases. The approach consists of developing highly automated solutions to the following tasks: discovering Web databases from the Web, clustering them according to their application domains, integrating the search interfaces of the Web databases in the same domain into an integrated search interface, mapping each query submitted to an integrated interface to its underlying Web databases, extracting and annotating the search result records from the result pages returned from the local Web databases, and merging the results to form an integrated response for presentation to the user. Web services based interfaces of Web databases, if available, will be utilized. The evaluation of the developed algorithms is based on real Web databases from different domains. This research is expected to produce new algorithms, useful datasets, a software toolkit, and several operational Web database metasearch engines (including some for the Air Force Research Lab at Rome). The developed technology can be used in many applications including comparison shopping and collecting data from the deep Web. Research results will be incorporated into several courses the PIs teach and students will be recruited to participate in the research activities. Research results will be disseminated through published papers as well as a textbook on Web-based search technology. The project Web site (http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~meng/DMSE.html) provides access to research results as well as datasets and demo systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The project investigates the design and implementation issues in the mointoring of information changes in large distributed networks such as the Internet and World Wide Web. One of the objectives is to develop efficient and scalable strategies, techniques, and systems support for distributed control of large numbers of information change monitoring requests. Research questions to be addressed include the following. What software techniques and tools are able to extract, integrate, and query streams of data over semi-structured or unstructured data? Which distributed trigger and data processing techniques are most scalable and yet efficient in the presence of millions of information change monitoring requests? How do change monitors adapt to wide system parameter variations in runtime environments such as the Internet? How do they scale up as the number of information sources reach millions? Critical system components include change detection algorithms (e.g., tree comparison for web pages), trigger and query grouping, indexing, and caching, as well as parallel processing. Appropriate components will be implemented and evaluated through simulation and measurements on the Internet. These experiments will emphasize the efficiency and scalability of Internet-scale information change monitoring systems. The research results will aid in the engineering, implementation and evaluation of systems and middleware software support for scalable and efficient processing of distributed triggers and queries, as well as effective detection and notification of information changes.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Brigham Young University (BYU) proposes to join the existing Center for e-Design that is currently comprised of Virginia Tech (lead), the University of Central Florida, the University of Massachusetts, and Carnegie Mellon University. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;BYU will complement the research umbrella by investigating, modifying, and prototyping, at kernel levels, new architectures for networked multi-user computer-aided applications (v-CAx). The new institution will add strategically to Center goals, because of its strong history in applications of modern CAx software. Faculty from various disciplines at BYU will be involved because of the scope of problems that must be addressed in a multi-user, architectural CAx environment. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The new university brings cultural diversity to the research that will be demanded by research prototypes. BYU will extend and integrate CAx applications through API libraries, computer OS architectures, network security, and business team conflict resolution. BYU has strong relationships with several international institutions that have expertise in gaming technologies. BYU&amp;apos;s strong dependence on both undergraduate and graduate students for development and testing, will provide students a rich educational experience. The university also plans to involve K-12 and post K-12 levels in the Center.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(Public Law 111-5). This project will investigate people&amp;apos;s social and moral relationships with personified robots. These robots, in various ways and to varying degrees, embody aspects of people insofar as they have a persona, are adaptive and autonomous, and can talk, learn, use natural cues, and self organize. This project will complete five complementary investigations: (1) Research on whether adults believe that a humanoid robot has feelings, is intelligent, can be a friend, is autonomous, and has moral standing (i.e., can be the recipient of unfair actions and unwarranted psychological harm). (2) A study of the extent to which children, adolescents, and adults believe that a robot can be responsible for harm it causes humans. (3) A study of moral standing and accountability that examines whether children, adolescents, and adults consider a humanoid robot most like a human, child, animal, or object - or as a new technological genre. (4) Research on whether children, adolescents, and adults believe that a robot is an entity that engenders trust and can be trusted. (5) A design study of patterns for sociality in human-robot interaction that characterizes essential features of social interaction between humans and robots. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Taken together, this body of work would provide for the first time a systematic account of social and moral behavior and reasoning with a humanoid robot that cuts across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In terms of basic science, this project will test the hypothesis that people do not simply act &amp;quot;as if &amp;quot; personified robots are social (like &amp;quot;characters&amp;quot; in a play), but engage personified robots sincerely and meaningfully as social others, and in some ways even as moral others. At the same time, this project would determine the extent to which human-robot interaction is not simply the mapping of human-human interactions (or human-animal interactions) onto robots, but represents a new genre: technological yet animate, personified, responsive, and seemingly autonomous.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;As personified robots become more prevalent and integrated into people&amp;apos;s everyday social lives, they will pose children and adults with significant challenges, socially and morally. The specific challenges will depend on how the robots are designed, their context of use, and on how people actually interact with such robots. In future, robots may become caretaking assistants for the elderly, academic tutors for children, or medical assistants, day care assistants, or psychological counselors. Thus, it is important to understand at the outset how different age groups respond to robots and conceptualize their increasingly complex behavior. It is likely in the near future that the public will raise serious concerns about the introduction of personified robots into society. Concerns may be voiced, for example, that interacting with personified robots will reify a master-servant relationship (with the robot as servant), or undermine authenticity of real social relationships. Parents, in particular, may voice concerns about the impacts of personified robots on their children. The results of this proactive research and design project will provide guidance in responding most appropriately to such concerns and will establish principles for assuring that robots will be used only for human benefit.</Abstract>

<Abstract>0108308&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Kamel &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Ahmed Kamel, Department of Computer Science, North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota and Dr. Ahmed Rafea, Department of Computer Science, The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt. They plan to devise new capabilities for complex-problem solvers by utilizing two technologies, the knowledge-based system technology, which is a mature technology, and the intelligent agents technology which is emerging and is still evolving. They plan to develop a distributed knowledge-based intelligent architecture for cooperative problem solving, and to test the new system in an application dealing with agricultural (wheat) production management. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Scope: The project supports collaboration between a US scientist and an Egyptian scientist in a research project that is timely and which has significant potential applications. The two PIs are currently collaborating on a project for the management of irrigated wheat in Egypt. That project is generating a working set of applications that will be utilized as a test bed for the distributed knowledge-based intelligent architecture developed in this research. Such architecture will be useful in many similar problems where the data sources and computer tools are geographically distributed. The research will involve one US graduate student and two graduate students from Egypt. This project meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.</Abstract>

<Abstract>*** SRI is investigating the properties of human interactions with a graphical terrain model as they would occur in a crisis situation, with a particular emphasis on elucidating the process of reference through natural language and gesture. First, the research team is augmenting existing theories of discourse salience to account for how entities are introduced through the visual display in addition to speech, and extending theories of reference resolution by incorporating mutually constraining effects of gesturing and properties of linguistic referring expressions. Second, the team is studying how discourse structure is affected by the structure of the terrain model and of the task being executed, and how it can be determined through a combination of speech and gestural cues. Third, they are studying how spatial terms are used in uniquely identifying referents in a terrain model, particularly with respect to perspective- relative relational terms. The data used are generated from a set of wizard-of-oz sessions with an existing multimodal route-planning system. The results of the research are demonstrated in proof-of-concept extensions to this system, and are measured by a systematic set of evaluation methods. This research carries out the first step toward the flexible integration of speech, gesture, and visual display that will be required by the interactive, multimodal systems of the future.***</Abstract>

<Abstract>Scientists and supporters of science have long worked to improve the sharing, reuse, storage, and retrieval of scientific data. Today, efforts focus on advanced &amp;quot;cyberinfrastructure&amp;quot;: using networked computers, databases, and organizations to bridge divides among diverse scientific disciplines. Cyberinfrastructure divides into three main activities. First, large numbers of automatic sensors monitor subjects of interest, such as ecosystems and Earth&amp;apos;s climate, producing massive volumes of digitized data. Second, in many fields computer models have replaced laboratory experiments as the principal means of data collection, prediction, and decision-making. Third, increasingly vast data resources (scientific memory) are now available, but are often distributed across thousands of research sites and institutions, in numerous incompatible formats. For cyberinfrastructure-enabled science to deliver on its transformative potential, cyberinfrastructure designers need better ways of understanding how scientists actually create and share data in practice, and how they use it to create new knowledge. To investigate data practices empirically, this project examines four large cyberinfrastructure efforts: the Long Term Ecological Research Network, the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, the WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network, and the Earth System Modeling Framework. In each case, the investigators will study how cyberinfrastructure is used in monitoring, modeling, and memory. These projects spread across many disciplines addressing three important domains, all related to climate change concerns: ecology and environment; hydrology and water management; and earth system science. In conducting the project, the investigators will develop innovative methods of distributed ethnography, collaborative history, and multimodal network analysis. In addition to published findings, the project will produce a &amp;apos;best practices&amp;apos; handbook meant to guide data practices and coordination in cyberinfrastructure. The project will partner with organizations working to enhance the role of women in computing; to build database systems for American Indian communities; and to engage other groups often ignored in information infrastructure development. The project will thus lay groundwork for an inclusive, theoretically rich, and practically engaged social science of cyberinfrastructure.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The objective of the proposed research is to improve network security through an innovative approach to vulnerability and resiliency analysis. Even well administered networks are vulnerable to attacks due to the security ramifications of offering a variety of combined services. That is, services that are secure when offered in isolation nonetheless provide an attacker with combined vulnerabilities to exploit when offered simultaneously. Security tools such as COPS, System Scanner, and CyberCop, are excellent at identifying specific, known, individual host vulnerabilities in services, software packages, and configurations. What these methods do not address is the compound effect of multiple vulnerabilities. The result is a serious problem because interactions between vulnerabilities can easily cascade across a network. The risk posed by each vulnerability may be judged either necessary or acceptable in isolation, but the combination of these vulnerabilities can still turn out to compromise the network as a whole in an unacceptable way. A limited amount of existing work in vulnerability analysis addresses this problem, but the existing work falls short in three key areas, namely resiliency analysis, all-paths analysis, and inference engine analysis. The proposed work will improve network security by addressing systematically each of these three areas.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Proposal 0534809&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Automating Commonsense reasoning for Elementary Physical Science&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI: Ernest S. Davis&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;New York University&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This goal of this project is to develop a symbolic knowledge base that integrates commonsense understanding of solids, liquids, and gasses with high-school level physics. The knowledge base is intended to support simple reasoning--projection, planning, and design--about physical systems such as barometers, pistons, beakers, pipes, valves, pumps, boxes, and doors. In addition to commonsensical and textbook physics knowledge, the knowledge base will incorporate a theory of action, a representation of partial spatial information, and multiple levels of abstraction. In the near future, the broader impact of this project includes training doctoral students and writing a semi-popular book discussing how commonsense knowledge interacts with mathematical calculations. In the long run, this research could substantially contribute to a large-scale knowledge base of scientific knowledge; autonomous robotics in open environments; automated design for physical tools; automated tutoring systems for elementary science; and cognitive theories of how the understanding of formal science is grounded in ordinary experience of the physical world.</Abstract>

<Abstract>*** 9224093 Malone How important are managerial tools like total quality management, business reengineering, and information technology? The goal of this project is to provide a firmer theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding and using them. To do this, the project will include (1) collecting examples of how different organizations perform similar processes, and (2) representing these examples in an on line &amp;quot;process hand book&amp;quot; which includes the relative advantages of the alternatives. The handbook is intended to help (a) redesign existing organizational processes, (b) invent new organizational processes that take advantage of information technology, and perhaps (c) automatically generate software to support organizational processes. A key intellectual contribution of the work is expected to be a novel approach to representing processes at various levels of abstraction. This approach uses ideas from computer science about inheritance and from coordination theory about managing dependencies. Its primary advantage is that it allows users to explicitly represent the similarities (and differences) among related processes and to easily find or generate sensible alternatives for how a given process could be performed. ***</Abstract>

<Abstract>Proposal Number 0722259&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;TITLE CPATH CB: Living In the KnowlEdge Society (LIKES)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI Edward A. Fox &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Living In the KnowlEdge Society (LIKES) Community Building project, led by four sites (Virginia Tech, Villanova, NC A&amp;amp;T, and U. Texas El Paso), is transforming computing education for the 21st Century. The LIKES community, in collaboration with those from other disciplines, is identifying key computing concepts in these disciplines, then developing and implementing tools and techniques that enable learning of both computing concepts and the concepts of the disciplines. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Through a series of four workshops, related online community discussions, and our own research, the LIKES community is discovering key computing related issues in core disciplines and engaging leaders nationwide in brainstorming about their computing (education) needs. This aids faculty members, in computing-related education programs, such as Computer Science and Information Systems Departments, and in core / liberal education courses, engage with each other to build the global Knowledge Society. Deliverables include (1) new pedagogies in computing education; (2) integration of computing concepts into non-computing disciplines; (3) principles, guidelines, and techniques for integrating computing and non-computing curriculums; and (4) formation of new communities for enhancing that integration. This transforming of education in computing-related disciplines will yield a next generation of builders of the Knowledge Society.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Global environmental change is essentially a human problem. It results from myriad human actions occurring in local places. At the same time, people experience and respond to global environmental changes in localities. Recognition of these facts have led to a proliferation of research centers and sites dedicated to studying the local and regional implications of the human dimensions of global environmental change (HDGEC). The local data that are and will be generated by these centers, however, tend to be place-specific and are difficult to replicate and generalize. This weakness in the data stems directly from a poorly developed scientific infrastructure. There are no common protocols for collecting, reporting, analyzing, storing, and sharing the data. There are no data standards, which are necessary if the data are to be a lasting resource. Moreover, if HDGEC scientists are to be able to take advantage of the technological advances that are being made in intelligent data retrieval and analysis and in remote collaboration, they must coordinate research efforts to make the data amenable to these techniques. To address these problems, this award will support a project to develop infrastructure for studying the long-term implications of HDGEC at small regional and local scales. To meet this goal, the five-year project will promote infrastructure development by implementing four core activities. First, it will develop protocols for observing, collecting, reporting, storing, and sharing data. Second, it will build an intelligent networking environment for data management, Web-based access, and GeoCollaboratory that will help match data with research problems and will facilitate collaboration among scientists at remote sites. Third, it will test proof of concept by applying the protocols and intelligent networking environment to local HDGEC research problems. Fourth, it will build networks by linking the US regional and local HDGEC research sites through this infrastructure. Protocol development will be carried out at four human-environment regional observatories (HEROs). The HEROs, which are located in the Southwest-Mexico border region, the High Plains of Kansas, central Pennsylvania, and central Massachusetts, represent a diverse set of natural and human environments. University of Arizona, Kansas State University, Pennsylvania State University, and Clark University scientists will approach infrastructural development by tackling a broad human-environment problem, but in the local context. The Geographic Visualization Science Technology and Applications Center (GeoVISTA) at Penn State will work with the National Mapping Division of the United States Geological Survey to develop the HERO intelligent networking environment (HEROINE). HEROINE will emphasize geospatial data, scientific research in human-environment interaction, and rapid development of distributed databases. To develop the a GeoCollaboratory, HEROINE will develop tools for data retrieval and collaborative query specification, geographic visualization (GVis) methods to support joint exploration of quantitative and qualitative data, and ways to integrate GVis and geocomputational methods, such as spatial statistics, data mining, or process models. The infrastructure developed by the HEROs and HEROINE will be tested and refined through iterative collaboration among the HEROs. The four HEROs will address one research question to test proof of concept: How does land use affect local sensitivity to climate variation and vulnerability to climate change? The project aims to promote adoption of the infrastructure by developing a network of regional and local HDGEC centers. Two open meetings of regional HDGEC investigators and an advanced Web-site are features of the network building. This project will generate significant products for science and society. The protocols and data standards will produce a template (meta-protocols) for assembling diverse data for use by other large-scale, interdisciplinary projects. The intelligent networking environment will serve as an archetype for bringing scientists together to solve complex interdisciplinary problems. In addition, the project will contribute to the overarching theme of human science and policy research throughout the 21st century -- the &amp;quot;sustainability transition.&amp;quot; It will preserve precious scientific data on human-environment relationships, thereby sustaining our historical and natural heritages. It will answer critical questions about the complex relationships among individuals, communities, and their environments over time and space, and it will provide a technological means to bring scientists, stakeholders, and decision-makers together to address fundamental issues linking nature and society.</Abstract>

<Abstract>CRUI: Teeth as Chemical Records of Chronological Changes in Diet and Environment&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Abstract&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The theme of this collaborative study is a fostering of better understanding of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;variations in trace element concentrations in human teeth and the processes that govern their incorporation into enamel and dentine. A central goal is to test the degree to which elemental concentrations in enamel and dentine reflect diet, nutrition and environmental exposure.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; This research is made possible by recent developments in analytical chemistry. Specifically, the development of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ( LA-ICP-MS ) makes possible an interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together complementary expertise and a research collection of over 400 teeth from persons residing in communities in Mexico and Egypt. The teeth are key resources because dietary intakes and other key factors were thoroughly documented during their calcification.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The distribution of a suite of elements in enamel and dentine ( including iron,zinc,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;lead, and strontium ) will be studied to determine elemental variation within these two relatively stable populations and between simultaneously developing dental tissues. The major thrust of this project is to determine the impact of three factors - diet, environment, and physiology - on tissue concentrations of the aformentioned elements. This study can provide a better understanding of tooth chemistry which could be applied to a wide range of concerns that may be biological, anthropological or environmental in nature.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project aims at solving a number of algorithmic and architectural&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;problems that will enable tabled logic programming engines, such as XSB&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(http://xsb.sourceforge.net), to become viable platforms for supporting the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;emerging infrastructure for the Semantic Web. The project will address the&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;following issues:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. Design of algorithms for solving a long-standing problem of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; inconsistency between tabling and update operations.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Designing an architecture for supporting explanation-based reasoning&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; at the engine level.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Developing low-overhead algorithms for allowing tabled query answers to be&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;correctly updated when changes occur to the underlying predicates is of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;critical importance in applications that require tabling and at the same&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;time frequently modify the data underlying those tables (such as workflow&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;schedulers, verification algorithms, database queries, CASE tools).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Explanation based reasoning is important for debugging and verification.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The project will develop a new technology, which will allow tabling logic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;engines to provide inference services for the Semantic Web. Logic&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;inference engines are expected to become a crucial part of the Semantic Web&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;infrastructure. Once in place, the Semantic Web will enable a host of&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;applications in information retrieval and Web services, which will become&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;inseparable part of people&amp;apos;s daily life.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research involves collaboration among investigators at three institutions. The PIs anticipate a future in which humans and intelligent robots will collaborate on shared tasks. To achieve this vision, a robot must have sufficiently rich knowledge of the task domain and that knowledge must be usable in ways that support effective communication between a human and the robot. Navigational space is one of the few task domains where the structure of the knowledge is sufficiently well understood for a physically-embodied robot agent to be a useful collaborator, meeting genuine human needs. In this project, the PIs will develop and evaluate an intelligent robot capable of being genuinely useful to a human, and capable of natural dialog with a human about their shared task.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (HSSH) is a human-inspired multi-ontology representation for knowledge of navigational space. The spatial representations in the HSSH provide for efficient incremental learning, graceful degradation under resource limitations, and natural interfaces for different kinds of human-robot interactions. Speech is a natural though demanding way to use natural language to communicate with a robot. To maintain real-time performance, natural language understanding must be organized to minimize the amount of backtracking from early conclusions in light of later information. This project will answer three scientific questions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) Can the HSSH framework, extended with real-time computer vision, express the kinds of knowledge of natural human environments that are relevant to navigation tasks? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(2) Can the HSSH representation support effective natural language communication in the spatial navigation domain? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) Can we develop effective human-robot interaction that meets the needs of a person and improves the performance of the system?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;To these ends, the PIs will perform this research with two different kinds of navigational robots, each learning from its travel experiences and building an increasingly sophisticated cognitive map: an intelligent robotic wheelchair which carries its human driver to desired destinations, and a telepresence robot that transmits its perceptions to a remote human driver as it navigates within an environment so the driver can achieve virtual presence and communicate with others remotely. To inform the design process, the PIs will conduct focus groups with potential users. They will also evaluate their implemented systems throughout the process, creating an iterative design-test cycle.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: To be successful, an intelligent robot must not only be able to perceive the world, represent what it learns, make useful inferences and plans, and act effectively. It must also be able to communicate effectively with other agents, and particularly with people. This confluence among grounded knowledge representation, situated natural language understanding, and human-robot interaction is intellectually fundamental, and is the focus of this research. Since the domain of spatial knowledge is foundational for virtually all aspects of human knowledge, project outcomes will have broad applicability. This work will create technologies for mobility assistance for people with disabilities in perception (blindness or low vision), cognition (developmental delay or dementia), or general frailty (old age). It will also support telepresence applications such as telecommuting, telemedicine and search and rescue. The project includes outreach to K-12 and community college students, K-12 teachers, and the public in a number of venues.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project addresses tool use by intelligent agents--so-called cognitive &amp;quot;habile&amp;quot; agents--in their environment. The research is inspired by examples of tool use among animals, ranging from chimpanzees that fish for insects with sticks to crows that bend wire into hooks. Tool use is viewed as a basis for intelligent behavior. The project focuses on three issues: (1) establishing general characteristics of cognitive habile agents, including development of a taxonomy of tools and their usages; (2) identifying core capabilities of habile agents, including their ability to enhance their interaction with the environment via tools, to perform detailed internal simulations of hypothetical scenarios for tool use, and to exploit symmetries in between tools and task constraints to identify opportunities for appropriate action; and (3) evaluating different control architectures (e.g., hierarchical, iterative) for such agents. It builds upon the PI&amp;apos;s recent NSF-supported work on agents and graphical user interfaces, which involved issues of control and cognitive modeling. The Broader Impact of this work will be realized in two ways related to undergraduate research and graduate education: undergraduate researchers are being involved in the research through the AURICS (Accelerated Undergraduate Research in Computer Science) program at NCSU, and a new graduate course focusing on building AI systems and topics related to this research (e.g., embodied agents, cognitive modeling, control architectures) is being developed.</Abstract>

Students will work as part of faculty-undergraduate teams on new problems ranging from traditional image processing (e.g. liver segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis, breast density assessment for cancer&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;detection) to structured reporting and natural language processing of radiology reports, to workflow and process re-engineering to the application of data mining and ontology-based means for image annotation and markup (e.g. lung nodule detection and interpretation). Ultimately, each project has the long-term potential to increase the quality of healthcare available to people everywhere.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Faculty mentors will conduct tutorials on imaging informatics, conduct biweekly meetings of students and mentors, and create an environment that will expose students to all phases of research and graduate school. Students will participate in defining the direction of their research, give presentations to the group as well as other audiences, write up and publish research results in the format of a conference or journal article, and participate in relevant conferences.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The MedIX REU site will run for three summers, with ten student participants doing research ten weeks each summer under the supervision of five mentors dedicated to undergraduate research. The site will be hosted by three interdisciplinary laboratories: the Medical Informatics Laboratory at DePaul University, the Imaging Informatics Laboratory at Northwestern University, and the Imaging Research Institute at the University of Chicago; the research environment will offer the students the opportunity to interact with computer scientists, medical physicists, and medical doctors.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;More information on the MedIX program can be found at http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/medix</Abstract>

<Abstract>Freudenberg-Krogh (collaborative) - Abstract&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The goal of this project is to develop concepts and tools for model-based development of embedded control systems for automotive x-by-wire systems. X-by-wire systems replace mechanical connections between the driver and the vehicle with embedded computers and actuators (e.g., motors) to control the automobile and provide physical responses to the driver. These systems are characterized by multiple, highly integrated and interacting feedback loops. This project is creating new methods for designing these embedded control systems to improve performance while enhancing safety and reliability and reducing development cost. The research draws on control theory to deal with physical dynamics and synthesis of the feedback loops and with formalisms and techniques from computer science to deal with the logical aspects of the embedded software. Using a laboratory implementation of a steer-by-wire system as a test bed, models of the dynamics, including driver behavior, are being analyzed using new compositional methods that make it possible to design elements of the embedded control systems with guaranteed performance characteristics. The theory of fundamental design limitations is being extended and applied to these models to evaluate the tradeoffs between dynamic performance and robustness. Verification methods for hybrid systems (systems with continuous and discrete state variables) are being developed to demonstrate the safety of the system, even when there are failures in sensors and other system components. Tractable verification problems are being developed based on model decompositions reflecting the model structure, time-scale separation, and novel representations of the interaction dynamics. The embedded software design is being implemented and evaluated on the laboratory test bed in cooperation with an industrial partner.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project involves research and experimentation with cyberinfrastructure components in order to develop and prototype new approaches to information technology for ocean observing systems. The goal is to develop and test ways of managing data from ocean observatories as well as mechanisms for facilitating the operation of ocean observatories. A centerpiece of the work is the initiation of a prototype ocean observatory grid that links submarine facilities off the Pacific coasts of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, the &amp;quot;Laboratory for an Ocean Observatory Knowledge INtegration Grid (LOOKING),&amp;quot; using experimental wireless networks, optical networks, and Grid technology. The LOOKING framework provides middleware to facilitate and enable instrument and infrastructure control, data generation and distributed storage, data assimilation through comparison with ocean simulations, integrative data fusion and analysis, visualization, and spontaneous user collaboration. The effort needed to develop this involves three parts: a physical layer based primarily on network connectivity provided by the OptIPuter and ROADNet projects; research on shore-side software technology based on web-service based implementations of a variety of tools including ocean ontology-based semantic search tools, event-detection in real-time data streams, the integration of OPeNDAP and SRB, and data visualization; and ocean-side research focused on instrument monitoring and control, as well as data-flow management. As part of the proposed work a converged data grid model for the MARS and ROADNet data systems will be developed, data from CODAR sites, ships, cabled observatories and surface buoys will be integrated into the system, and a variety of user services will be implemented. The expectation is that lessons learned from this activity will inform the design of cyberinfrastructure systems for future ocean observatories such as those envisaged within the ORION project. If successful, this project could have a significant impact on the success of the planned ORION ocean observatory project by developing data management and observatory control approaches that can be implemented in ORION and by developing effective user interfaces to a collection of ocean observing systems. Research challenges include developing a software infrastructure suitable for heterogeneous real-time data streams, monitoring and control in non-robust networks, and real-time event detection and characterization. This project involves numerous institutions and combines the efforts of computer science researchers and oceanographers. It leverages, or links to, a number of existing or funded pilot observatory, networking and data system projects including: SCCOOS, MARS, NEPTUNE-Canada, ROADNet, and OptIPuter. New approaches to ocean observing systems involve large arrays of sensors and many mobile, robotic platforms for research and educational activities throughout the ocean basins. Innovative full-ocean-depth observatories in coastal, regional, and global settings can vastly expand human tele-presence within, and the basic understanding of, interlinked processes that modulate climate, create energy and mineral deposits, influence the carbon cycle, drive major hazards, such as earthquakes, tsunami&amp;apos;s and violent storms, and support the recently discovered volcanically hosted microbial biosphere-a potential analog for life on other planets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The large number of documents in biomedical literature databases and the lack of formal structure in the natural-language narrative in those documents make the search and processing very difficult to many scientists involved in bioinformatics research. This CAREER project is investigating the efficiency and effectiveness of information retrieval procedures, the effectiveness and robustness of pattern learning methods for information extraction, and information overload in text mining simultaneously in a coherent and unified framework for biomedical literature data mining. The deliverables of this project are: (1) to develop a semantic-based query expansion method for large biomedical literature databases; (2) to design an automatic pattern generation and evaluation method from unlabeled text files based on mutual bootstrapping and dynamic programming; (3) to develop a set of novel text mining algorithms such as ontology-enhanced textual clustering and text summarization. This project is testing its application in real-world bioinformatics domains such as chromatin interaction networks and microarray data analysis. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The broad impact on society made by this project is the generation of a novel unified architecture for biomedical literature data mining. This integrated and complementary approach in a unified architecture has the potential to create a very powerful novel tool for bioinformatics and for most text processing tasks. This project has the potential to attract diverse collaborators who have an interest in accessing complex biomedical or general scientific data and information. Students are involved in this research through hands-on projects, a Co-Op program and courses at both the graduate and undergraduate level.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research objective of this award is to develop methods to enable fast and reliable evaluation of the impact of a proposed Engineering Change (EC). Engineering Change refers to a change to the shape, dimensions, structure, material, manufacturing process, etc. of a part or assembly after the initial design has been released. Evaluating ECs is a time-consuming process due to the complexity of typical products and the lifecycle-wide impact of a change. The research focus is on the development of (i) meaningful representations of ECs and (ii) techniques for searching previous similar ECs. Complexities stem from the disparity of resources that can cause or are affected by the engineering change. This research assumes the existence of a Cyberinfrastructure (CI) and focuses on the design of CI-aware models and solution approaches. Techniques from ontology-based computing, information theory and machine learning are used. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, this research will provide a scientific foundation to the current ad-hoc change evaluation process. It will advance our understanding of how the disparate components of engineering change data relate to each other. The research results will benefit designers in the context of globalization, which is increasing the pressure to manage component and process changes while maintaining or improving quality and reducing costs with shorter turn-around times. Fast, accurate and reliable evaluation of the impact of engineering changes will result in cost benefits to industry and the US government that extend beyond benefits realized by just overcoming errors or incremental improvements in the design or manufacturing processes. Results will be disseminated through the University of Michigan?s PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) Alliance and included in a graduate course in Global Product Development that brings together students from the U.S., Germany, and South Korea to work in global design teams. Results will also be disseminated through various publications and the development of open-source software tools which will be available for industry and academia evaluation. Graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to multidisciplinary, global research and development as a result of this award.</Abstract>

<Abstract>In recent years significant momentum has occurred in the development of Internet resources for decision makers, scientists and the general public who are interested in the coast. Coastal mapping plays an important role in informing decision makers on issues such as national sovereignty, resource management, maritime safety and hazard assessment. A key trend has been the development of coastal web atlases (CWAs), defined as a collection of digital maps and datasets with supplementary tables, illustrations, and information that systematically illustrate the coast, oftentimes with cartographic and decision support tools. They are playing an increasingly crucial role in informing regional decision- and policy-making across the themes of coastal governance, hazard mitigation, climate change impacts and vulnerability mapping, marine spatial planning, and more. While multiple benefits are derived from tailor-made atlases, the potential exists to derive added value from the integration of disparate CWAs, to optimize decision making at a variety of levels and across themes. And while digital data sets have continued to grow exponentially, our ability to derive meaning, knowledge and management decisions from all of these data in an analytical context remains poor. In response to the need for coordinated CWA, the International Coastal Atlas Network (ICAN) was recently established. This Newtwork consists of 35 organizations from 10 countries, and has garnered the interest of local and state governments, non-governmental organizations, universities, NOAA, the European Environment Agency (EEA), and UNESCO. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Dr. Dawn Wright from Oregon State University will convene two international workshops that bring together key experts from Europe, the United States, eastern and southern Africa, and the Caribbean that will (1) finalize the governance and strategic planning structure for ICAN; (2) further ICAN&amp;apos;s mission of establishing scientific grounding and knowledge base among the important knowledge domains of CWA development (geography, computer science, and coastal resource management), (3) develop advances in semantic interoperability for CWAs, (4) exchange lessons learned in spatial data infrastructure between the US and Europe&amp;apos;s INSPIRE initiative, and (5) prepare collaborative submissions to the next available NSF INTEROP and PIRE competitions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;These workshops will provide a model for how other scholars and management agencies might develop informatics solutions to address the critical state of our coastal zones and fisheries. The project will develop recommendations that could potentially save thousands to millions of U.S. dollars and Euros in the prevention or mitigation of failed coastal development projects.</Abstract>

<Abstract>An award has been made to Mississippi State University that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, during the summers of 2010-2012. This project is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Computer Information Science and Engineering (CISE). Undergraduate students will be recruited from institutions throughout Mississippi and the surrounding area to work on interdisciplinary research projects in computational biology. Students will work closely with their faculty mentors on projects in the areas of genome analysis, functional genomics, artificial intelligence, scientific visualization, and bio-ontologies, among others. Recruitment will be targeted at colleges and universities within Mississippi and the surrounding states with the goal of providing a meaningful research experience to promising undergraduate students who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to engage in research. There is a particular focus on increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in computational biology research. Educational and professional development sessions will be conducted to train students in the basics of computational biology and to provide information on graduate school and pursuing scientific careers. Students will also receive training and mentoring in the responsible conduct of research. The program will culminate with a poster session where the students will present their research findings to the computational biology community at Mississippi State University. Program objectives will be assessed through the use of a common web-based assessment tool. More information about this program can be obtained by contacting the project PI, Dr. Andy Perkins (perkins@cse.msstate.edu) at (662) 325-0004, or by visiting the project website at http://www.cse.msstate.edu/~compbio/.</Abstract>

<Abstract>With its accessibility and explosive growth of content, the NSDL repositories are in a prime position to provide quality material teachers and other knowledge seekers need. Still, studies show teachers&amp;apos; dissatisfaction with online resources. They are frustrated with the time-consuming manual effort to retrieve and review each link when searching for appropriate material. This often leads to settling for good enough content. To sustain and increase the utilization of NSDL&amp;apos;s quality resources, it is important a more sophisticated methodology for query and retrieval be developed.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Query in Context for Educational Collections (QIC) is a research project utilizing context sensitive retrieval, semantic query analysis, and concept extraction techniques to create QIC&amp;apos;s portable unified knowledge discovery system. QIC minimizes human intervention in the extraction process and reduces the number of contextually inaccurate results displayed. It revolutionizes individual search by shifting the burden of information overload from the user to the computer. QIC&amp;apos;s functionality extends NSDL&amp;apos;s NCore search services without significant changes to the format and organization of digital collections or extensive additional user provided data. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;With QIC, teachers find relevant information in the initially retrieved entries, thereby increasing satisfaction through reduced time and effort. This effectiveness improves digital library utilization, encourages knowledge seeking, and idea exploration. This contributes to the sustainability of NSDL and partner collections. QIC&amp;apos;s long-term goal is to provide personalized information retrieval by discovering information in multiple formats and incorporating Web2.0 tools to improve the display and relevance of results.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research involves collaboration among investigators at three institutions. The PIs anticipate a future in which humans and intelligent robots will collaborate on shared tasks. To achieve this vision, a robot must have sufficiently rich knowledge of the task domain and that knowledge must be usable in ways that support effective communication between a human and the robot. Navigational space is one of the few task domains where the structure of the knowledge is sufficiently well understood for a physically-embodied robot agent to be a useful collaborator, meeting genuine human needs. In this project, the PIs will develop and evaluate an intelligent robot capable of being genuinely useful to a human, and capable of natural dialog with a human about their shared task.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (HSSH) is a human-inspired multi-ontology representation for knowledge of navigational space. The spatial representations in the HSSH provide for efficient incremental learning, graceful degradation under resource limitations, and natural interfaces for different kinds of human-robot interactions. Speech is a natural though demanding way to use natural language to communicate with a robot. To maintain real-time performance, natural language understanding must be organized to minimize the amount of backtracking from early conclusions in light of later information. This project will answer three scientific questions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) Can the HSSH framework, extended with real-time computer vision, express the kinds of knowledge of natural human environments that are relevant to navigation tasks? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(2) Can the HSSH representation support effective natural language communication in the spatial navigation domain? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) Can we develop effective human-robot interaction that meets the needs of a person and improves the performance of the system?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;To these ends, the PIs will perform this research with two different kinds of navigational robots, each learning from its travel experiences and building an increasingly sophisticated cognitive map: an intelligent robotic wheelchair which carries its human driver to desired destinations, and a telepresence robot that transmits its perceptions to a remote human driver as it navigates within an environment so the driver can achieve virtual presence and communicate with others remotely. To inform the design process, the PIs will conduct focus groups with potential users. They will also evaluate their implemented systems throughout the process, creating an iterative design-test cycle.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: To be successful, an intelligent robot must not only be able to perceive the world, represent what it learns, make useful inferences and plans, and act effectively. It must also be able to communicate effectively with other agents, and particularly with people. This confluence among grounded knowledge representation, situated natural language understanding, and human-robot interaction is intellectually fundamental, and is the focus of this research. Since the domain of spatial knowledge is foundational for virtually all aspects of human knowledge, project outcomes will have broad applicability. This work will create technologies for mobility assistance for people with disabilities in perception (blindness or low vision), cognition (developmental delay or dementia), or general frailty (old age). It will also support telepresence applications such as telecommuting, telemedicine and search and rescue. The project includes outreach to K-12 and community college students, K-12 teachers, and the public in a number of venues.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Infectious disease outbreaks, either naturally occurring or caused by terror attacks, pose a critical threat to public health and national security. Information systems and infectious disease informatics (IDI) research are playing an increasingly important role in developing a comprehensive approach to prevent, detect, respond to, and manage infectious disease outbreaks. Computerized datasets on infectious diseases are currently used for disease reporting, including those developed by various federal, state, and local health, agriculture, and environment/wildlife agencies. However, such datasets are typically not interoperable, particularly in across jurisdiction and across species contexts, reducing their effective use in data modeling and analysis, disease surveillance, and disease management-related decision-making. In addition, the information management environment used by public health officials and researchers to analyze large amounts of infectious disease data and develop predictive models needs major improvements.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;A partnership has been developed with expertise in IDI, mission-critical Web-based interoperable systems, data security and access control, advanced data mining and visualization techniques, disease surveillance and predictive modeling, and information systems evaluation. The partnership includes: (1) the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Arizona, (2) the Information Systems Group at the University of Utah, (3) the New York State Department of Health and its partner Health Research, Inc., and (4) the California State Department of Health Services and its partner PHFE Management Solutions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Building on ongoing IDI research and infrastructure development efforts, research is aimed at (a) developing an integrated and scalable information sharing, monitoring, and analysis environment across jurisdictions and species for major infectious diseases, (b) developing novel data analysis, surveillance, and visualization techniques to meet the critical needs of IDI, and (c) gaining a systematic understanding of related policy, user evaluation, and technology adoption issues.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The intended intellectual contributions are threefold: (1) developing and evaluating system performance and scalability models and related algorithms needed for the efficient operation of large-scale realtime information query and monitoring/surveillance systems such as the NIDII, (2) developing and evaluating a set of novel spatio-temporal data analysis and online surveillance techniques which can be used in both IDI and other applications needing similar capabilities (e.g., crime analysis), and (3) developing a comprehensive user evaluation and technology adoption framework and conducting a detailed user evaluation and organizational impact study of the developed IDI system and related technologies.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed work will have the following major broader impacts: (a) The research team will develop a working infectious disease information system across jurisdictions and disease types, providing an integrated data sharing, access, analysis, visualization, and surveillance environment for researchers, public health officials, and law enforcement and national security officials who need to assess risk of and respond to biological terror attacks. (b) The work will bring together previously disparate research and practitioner communities to conduct IDI research of significant practical relevance. In addition, it will foster cross-fertilization between law enforce and national security research and IDI.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research proposal addresses electric power system security, the ability of the high voltage transmission and generation interconnected grid to respond to disturbances in the network without equipment damage, load interruption, cascading outages, or blackouts. It represents a component of reliability that is of great interest to those who operate the power system, as it is the security level that determines their flexibility in responding to the economic imperatives of the electric energy markets that have evolved during the 1990s. Because of existing and future disincentives to constructing new transmission facilities, high voltage operating conditions are increasingly stressed, and the key to maintaining attractive energy prices is to efficiently utilize the existing transmission equipment. Efficient equipment utilization involves careful balancing of the security level against the market needs a continuous decision making problem. The underlying thesis In this proposal is that diversity of participants, heterogeneity and dispersion of required data, and Inherent complexity associated with today&amp;apos;s security-economy decision-making problem necessitates development of new information management and decision-support Infrastructure. Our objective is to develop the foundation for this infrastructure, using mobile software agents within a distributed knowledge network. Anticipated results of the proposed research include: much-needed algorithmic and systems solutions for monitoring and coordination of complex, dynamic, deregulated power grids as well as for distributed decision making taking into account the financial needs associated with market efficiency as well as the engineering (but ultimately financial as well) needs associated with maintaining reliability of the electric power system. The proposed work will result in a modular and extensible suite of distributed knowledge network tools for monitoring of dynamic, distributed systems in general, and power systems in particular. A specific outcome is to be a working prototype simulator that will clearly illustrate the benefits of the approach. The broader impacts as envisioned by the authors are the social benefits that would accrue to the society and to the economy at large, due to improved decision-support for operating the high voltage electric energy system, a critical part of the US national infrastructure.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Robotics is currently at the forefront of technologies with recognized potential for impacting quality of human life. In response to the large need for personalized one-on-one care for the growing populations of elderly individuals and those with special cognitive and social needs throughout life, great strides must be made in the domain of human-robot interaction (HRI) in order to bring robotics into such application domains in human everyday life. This interdisciplinary project identifies a specific set of HRI research questions in socially assistive robotics, the study of robotic systems capable of providing help through social rather than physical interaction. The research focus is on two key issues: (1) the role of the robot&amp;apos;s physical embodiment in the interaction; and (2) the use of expressive embodied communication and user modeling toward personalized time-extended assistive interaction. A specific consideration is given to interactions under the challenges of socio-communicative heterogeneity and deficits. A novel assistive robot control architecture is developed, based on multi-modal perception, embodied expression and communication, and on-line user modeling, implemented in three different types of real-world socially assistive systems. To give a realistic context to the research, the experimental testing and evaluation are performed with children drawn from a typical population and a population with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), a family of disorders that have already been identified as amenable to technological, and in particular robotic, intervention and therapy. A key contribution of the research lies in the unified and tightly integrated end-to-end approach that jointly studies embodiment and multimodal expressive communication, grounded in data from hypothesis-driven experiments, and the development and use of novel signal processing and user modeling methods for human-machine interaction design. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project, by its very nature, aims to impact the large and growing population affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders. With the support of the large and unique corpus of data that will be collected and analyzed, the expected scientific impact will go well beyond novel insights toward a better understanding of the fundamentals of HRI and its relevance for diverse user populations and for socialization of children with ASD. In addition to the basic research, two complementary educational outreach programs broaden the impact of the work: (1) a novel K-12 outreach and teacher training program specifically aimed at special education through the use of robotics for teaching STEM topics; and (2) undergraduate research training and pipelined role-modeling from pre-university to undergraduate to graduate students. The education programs dovetail with the research plan, resulting in integrated activities involving all participants in the research team.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Proposal #: CNS 07-09296 &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;PI(s): Mataric, Maja J.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Narayanan, Shrikanth S. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Institution: University of Southern California&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Los Angeles, CA 90089-1147 &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Title: IAD:Computing Research Infrastructure for Human-Robot Interaction and Socially Assistive Robotics &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project, acquiring infrastructure for socially assistive robotics (SAR), enables interdisciplinary integrative research covering a broad spectrum of human robot interaction (HRI) topics. SAR studies a unique series of problems related to utilizing robot embodiment to provide social assistance to users in a variety of convalescence, rehabilitation, education, and training settings. The infrastructure consists of richly interactive humanoid robot platforms and state-of-the-art data collection equipment. The work enables the growth of SAR, providing grounding for a major area of HRI research by requiring realistic validation with human subjects/users for studies that include embodiment, affect/attitude modeling and recognition, mixed initiative interactions, user modeling, modeling personality and empathy, and engagement and learning through imitation. The facility is expected to produce a large corpus of data that will be made available to the community.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impact: Socially accepted robotics research aims to improve quality of life. Enabling the acquisition of pilot data necessary for NIH funding, this research brings new expertise through an interdisciplinary team that includes CS, EE, kinesiology, pediatrics, and development of disorder experts. Furthermore, the infrastructure impacts human resource development through educational and K-12 outreach programs that reach hundreds of students.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This research involves collaboration among investigators at three institutions. The PIs anticipate a future in which humans and intelligent robots will collaborate on shared tasks. To achieve this vision, a robot must have sufficiently rich knowledge of the task domain and that knowledge must be usable in ways that support effective communication between a human and the robot. Navigational space is one of the few task domains where the structure of the knowledge is sufficiently well understood for a physically-embodied robot agent to be a useful collaborator, meeting genuine human needs. In this project, the PIs will develop and evaluate an intelligent robot capable of being genuinely useful to a human, and capable of natural dialog with a human about their shared task.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (HSSH) is a human-inspired multi-ontology representation for knowledge of navigational space. The spatial representations in the HSSH provide for efficient incremental learning, graceful degradation under resource limitations, and natural interfaces for different kinds of human-robot interactions. Speech is a natural though demanding way to use natural language to communicate with a robot. To maintain real-time performance, natural language understanding must be organized to minimize the amount of backtracking from early conclusions in light of later information. This project will answer three scientific questions.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(1) Can the HSSH framework, extended with real-time computer vision, express the kinds of knowledge of natural human environments that are relevant to navigation tasks? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;(2) Can the HSSH representation support effective natural language communication in the spatial navigation domain? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) Can we develop effective human-robot interaction that meets the needs of a person and improves the performance of the system?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;To these ends, the PIs will perform this research with two different kinds of navigational robots, each learning from its travel experiences and building an increasingly sophisticated cognitive map: an intelligent robotic wheelchair which carries its human driver to desired destinations, and a telepresence robot that transmits its perceptions to a remote human driver as it navigates within an environment so the driver can achieve virtual presence and communicate with others remotely. To inform the design process, the PIs will conduct focus groups with potential users. They will also evaluate their implemented systems throughout the process, creating an iterative design-test cycle.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: To be successful, an intelligent robot must not only be able to perceive the world, represent what it learns, make useful inferences and plans, and act effectively. It must also be able to communicate effectively with other agents, and particularly with people. This confluence among grounded knowledge representation, situated natural language understanding, and human-robot interaction is intellectually fundamental, and is the focus of this research. Since the domain of spatial knowledge is foundational for virtually all aspects of human knowledge, project outcomes will have broad applicability. This work will create technologies for mobility assistance for people with disabilities in perception (blindness or low vision), cognition (developmental delay or dementia), or general frailty (old age). It will also support telepresence applications such as telecommuting, telemedicine and search and rescue. The project includes outreach to K-12 and community college students, K-12 teachers, and the public in a number of venues.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Florida International University?s (FIU?s) proposed second-phase NSF CREST Center for Innovative Information Systems Engineering brings together a multidisciplinary group of researchers, large-scale collaborative relationships, and a broad ecosystem of partners to perform research that will lead to information technologies that help to solve critical societal problems of national priority. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Intellectual Merit: Each of the Center?s mutually-supportive subprojects builds on the strong research foundation established by FIU?s first-phase CREST award and each sets ambitious research goals that will result in the increased competitiveness of FIU?s CISE researchers. By intertwining these multidisciplinary research goals with CREST?s comprehensive education environment and by leveraging the synergistic academic and industry partnerships introduced above, the Subprojects provide one another with strong impetus for cohesiveness and potential for new research findings and educational breakthroughs: Subproject 1: Effective Access to Complex Multimodal Data with Applications in Disaster Mitigation will focus on developing effective techniques for managing and providing access to data that varies in type, source, location, time, and certainty by addressing storage optimization, data management, indexing and search, query techniques, and data presentation. Among its applications, it seeks to develop techniques to get the right information to the right people at the right time, thereby helping to mitigate disasters and to recover from them quickly. Subproject 2: Integrated Approach to Information Processing in Neuroscience focuses on an integrated imaging/signal processing approach that will result in comprehensive views of the human brain in greater depth and detail through faster, affordable, more effective, and less invasive methods. Subproject 3: Human Computer Interaction for Universal Access has a long-term goal of enabling any prospective computer user to interact with computer-based systems, regardless of their disability status and regardless of the interaction challenges derived from the context in which the interaction is taking place. Subproject 4: Complex System Modeling, Analysis, and Realization will focus on essential methodologies for modeling complex systems, a unified underlying semantic model, fundamental methods for compositional model analysis, and model-driven engineering technologies. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impacts: The Center will build upon the solid research foundation and flourishing educational pipeline developed over the course of FIU&amp;apos;s first-phase CREST funding. Its research program will develop effective techniques for managing information, for modeling information, natural, and man-made systems, and for providing access to information while its educational program strives to become the nation?s leader in training underrepresented Ph.D. students in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The proposed research areas cross the boundaries of computer science and engineering, information processing, situational awareness, assistive technology, and neuroscience; this integrative approach of research will significantly advance the body of knowledge in these important fields and will make strides to solving some of society?s critical problems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>EIA-0203958 Anupam Joshi University of Maryland-Baltimore County Agent Oriented Approaches to a Ubiquitous Grid&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;At the level of computing and networking hardware we will see dramatic changes in the next few years. Computing will become pervasive. These developments will lead to wireless networks that will scale all the way from ad hoc body area networks to satellite WANs, and link together supercomputers, &amp;quot;palmstations&amp;quot; and embededded sensors &amp;amp; controllers.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Given this scenario, our proposed research will seek to extend the computational grid by making it ubiquitous and pervasive. In particular, we will develop agent based runtime systems where each component is autonomous, articulate, social and adaptive. Such a system will seamlessly partition computation across elements of the grid ranging from palmtops to supercomputers. Issues that we will investigate include (i) Component/Service Discovery, (ii) Dynamic Composition of components, and (iii) computation partition across highly asymmetric and heterogeneous systems.</Abstract>

<Abstract>0225673&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Baru&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The GEOscience Network (GEON) project seeks to bring leading-edge information management research to bear on creating a cyberinfrastructure for the solid earth geosciences to interlink multidisciplinary geoscience data sets in 4D space. The need to manage the growing amounts of diverse Earth science data has been recognized through a series of NSF-sponsored community meetings on Geoinformatics. The GEON collaboration between IT researchers, who represent key technology areas relevant to GEON, and Earth science researchers, who represent a broad cross section of Earth science sub-disciplines, will provide the foundation for a national Geoinformatics program.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;There is a pressing need in the Earth sciences for a national information infrastructure that enables the community to share databases and tools to enable interdisciplinary analysis of networked data sets in studying a wide range of phenomena including the interplay between tectonics and the evolution of sedimentary basins; the role of mountain building in the evolution of climate and life; broader predictive understanding and modeling capabilities of geologic hazards, such as earthquakes and volcanoes; the 4D reconstruction of the Earth through time; and, managing the natural resources of our planet. Each of these problems requires interdisciplinary research to discover relationships among Earth science disciplines, and depends on the community&amp;apos;s ability to construct an integrated geoscience information system. The goal of GEON is to develop the necessary IT foundations and create such a system.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Many past and on-going projects in the geosciences have produced valuable sub-disciplinary and disciplinary databases. Numerous national centers and organizations such as IRIS, UNAVCO, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), as well as government agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), are contributing research and data to the community. Building on this base, the imperative now is to take a step beyond research resulting in disciplinary databases, towards a new paradigm for interdisciplinary information integration and tool sharing via the creation of the GEON cyberinfrastructure. The research products and services arising from GEON will be available to the entire scientific community and will transform the way in which geoscience research is conducted, opening unprecedented avenues for research and collaboration and providing the foundation for creating geoscience collaboratories.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;***</Abstract>

<Abstract>Attributing function to genes, their regulatory elements and other functional DNA sequences will be the next step in genomics. This functional phase involves researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and engineering. To facilitate the use of genomic informatin in function studies, pathways will be used to present the information. Pathways require detailed integration of diverse sources of information. Researchers will need transparent access that will be provided through this project. The project will integrate the data from a pathways rather than a sequence perspective, enabling scientists who do not do the sequencing to add functional information. New tools will enable users to visualize pathways data at mutiple levels of detail and abstraction. The use of XML will permit dissemination of query outputs for control of the data. Metabolic pathways, transcriptional regulation and protein synthesis pathways and signal transduction pathways will be the first incorporated in this web-based system. The research provides both for student support in both biology and computer science and a resource for the functional genomics community.</Abstract>

Such EMA environments show huge potential for efficiently automating workflow processes across heterogeneous administrative domains, and for facilitating unprecedented levels of system interactions and information and resource sharing. In particular, the project takes a holistic approach to synthesizing a solution that combines (i) a comprehensive trust-based, adaptive, content and context based access control and secure interoperation framework to facilitate the interaction of constituent domains in an EMA environment, and (ii) a comprehensive framework for addressing the privacy and digital rights management issues related to sharing of multimedia data and workflows. The research will produce required theory, efficient algorithms, specification languages, negotiation protocols, and analysis and administration tools founded on sound design principles and usability considerations which will be validated in a prototype EMA environment. The results are expected to have direct and long-term impact on developing secure data and resource intensive heterogeneous application environments, and will contribute significantly to current efforts related to the protection of complex systems and infrastructures such as the national and global information grid. The research results will be incorporated into the security curriculum of the University of Pittsburgh, which has been designated a national center of academic excellence in information assurance education, and disseminated through publication venues and the project website (http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~jjoshi/nsfcareer/).</Abstract>

<Abstract>The research objective of this award is to develop methods to enable fast and reliable evaluation of the impact of a proposed Engineering Change (EC). Engineering Change refers to a change to the shape, dimensions, structure, material, manufacturing process, etc. of a part or assembly after the initial design has been released. Evaluating ECs is a time-consuming process due to the complexity of typical products and the lifecycle-wide impact of a change. The research focus is on the development of (i) meaningful representations of ECs and (ii) techniques for searching previous similar ECs. Complexities stem from the disparity of resources that can cause or are affected by the engineering change. This research assumes the existence of a Cyberinfrastructure (CI) and focuses on the design of CI-aware models and solution approaches. Techniques from ontology-based computing, information theory and machine learning are used. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If successful, this research will provide a scientific foundation to the current ad-hoc change evaluation process. It will advance our understanding of how the disparate components of engineering change data relate to each other. The research results will benefit designers in the context of globalization, which is increasing the pressure to manage component and process changes while maintaining or improving quality and reducing costs with shorter turn-around times. Fast, accurate and reliable evaluation of the impact of engineering changes will result in cost benefits to industry and the US government that extend beyond benefits realized by just overcoming errors or incremental improvements in the design or manufacturing processes. Results will be disseminated through the University of Michigan?s PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) Alliance and included in a graduate course in Global Product Development that brings together students from the U.S., Germany, and South Korea to work in global design teams. Results will also be disseminated through various publications and the development of open-source software tools which will be available for industry and academia evaluation. Graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to multidisciplinary, global research and development as a result of this award.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will investigate the application of geographic information science concepts and methods to the modeling and analysis of genome data. The primary objective of the research is to develop a data model for genomes that supports the graphical exploration of the higher order spatial arrangement of genome features through spatial queries and spatial data analysis tools. The spatial genome model formalizes topological and order relationships among genome features (before, after, overlap), uses metric properties to refine spatial topologies, and includes representations of features that have uncertain metric properties. The genome spatial model enhances the integrative and comparative potential of genome data by providing the foundation for more powerful spatial reasoning and inferences than can be achieved by data models that incorporate only a small subset of possible temporal-spatial relationships among genome features (e.g. order and distance). The research represents a logical extension from current &amp;quot;feature by feature&amp;quot; analytical approaches of genome studies to one that allows biologists to ask questions about the contextual and organizational significance of the spatial arrangement of genome features. These functional capabilities should, in turn, aid in the automation of repetitive analytical tasks associated with the mapping of genome features and drive the discovery of biologically significant aspects of genome organization and function.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will take advantage of opportunities arising from an earlier grant from the Digital Govnernment program (9983468) and has two objectives: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. Quickly, while government program managers who partnered on the earlier award are still in place, develop backend systems that allow data sharing among different agencies and the front-end interface system that will be visible to the citizens and businesses of the State of New Jersey. This effort will lead to technology transfer of the prototype system to the State of New Jersey. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Conduct a transnational comparison evaluation study of similar human-centered systems for government on-line services in European Union countries. This effort will provide critical knowledge for developing US/EU digital government research collaborations and might lead to technology sharing among several countries. The study will concentrate on developing a methodology for comparative analysis and surveying of the European case literature, and will help establish common discussion areas between different projects and programs that aim to achieve the similar objectives.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project involves research and experimentation with cyberinfrastructure components in order to develop and prototype new approaches to information technology for ocean observing systems. The goal is to develop and test ways of managing data from ocean observatories as well as mechanisms for facilitating the operation of ocean observatories. A centerpiece of the work is the initiation of a prototype ocean observatory grid that links submarine facilities off the Pacific coasts of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, the &amp;quot;Laboratory for an Ocean Observatory Knowledge INtegration Grid (LOOKING),&amp;quot; using experimental wireless networks, optical networks, and Grid technology. The LOOKING framework provides middleware to facilitate and enable instrument and infrastructure control, data generation and distributed storage, data assimilation through comparison with ocean simulations, integrative data fusion and analysis, visualization, and spontaneous user collaboration. The effort needed to develop this involves three parts: a physical layer based primarily on network connectivity provided by the OptIPuter and ROADNet projects; research on shore-side software technology based on web-service based implementations of a variety of tools including ocean ontology-based semantic search tools, event-detection in real-time data streams, the integration of OPeNDAP and SRB, and data visualization; and ocean-side research focused on instrument monitoring and control, as well as data-flow management. As part of the proposed work a converged data grid model for the MARS and ROADNet data systems will be developed, data from CODAR sites, ships, cabled observatories and surface buoys will be integrated into the system, and a variety of user services will be implemented. The expectation is that lessons learned from this activity will inform the design of cyberinfrastructure systems for future ocean observatories such as those envisaged within the ORION project. If successful, this project could have a significant impact on the success of the planned ORION ocean observatory project by developing data management and observatory control approaches that can be implemented in ORION and by developing effective user interfaces to a collection of ocean observing systems. Research challenges include developing a software infrastructure suitable for heterogeneous real-time data streams, monitoring and control in non-robust networks, and real-time event detection and characterization. This project involves numerous institutions and combines the efforts of computer science researchers and oceanographers. It leverages, or links to, a number of existing or funded pilot observatory, networking and data system projects including: SCCOOS, MARS, NEPTUNE-Canada, ROADNet, and OptIPuter. New approaches to ocean observing systems involve large arrays of sensors and many mobile, robotic platforms for research and educational activities throughout the ocean basins. Innovative full-ocean-depth observatories in coastal, regional, and global settings can vastly expand human tele-presence within, and the basic understanding of, interlinked processes that modulate climate, create energy and mineral deposits, influence the carbon cycle, drive major hazards, such as earthquakes, tsunami&amp;apos;s and violent storms, and support the recently discovered volcanically hosted microbial biosphere-a potential analog for life on other planets.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This three-year award is a collaborative project by the University of California-San Diego, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Indiana University to automate the extensibility and scalability of data-generating networks. Rapid advances and deployment of cyberinfrastructure and sensor networks have created opportunities for new knowledge of ecological systems and their role in global environmental processes. Expanding current networks and developing new networks capable of addressing the spatial and temporal variability of important ecological processes such as lake metabolism at regional to global scales will require novel technical improvements in an architecture that transports data from sensors to databases, allows dynamic control of sensors and reconfiguration of the network, addresses data quality assurance, provides data access and query to distributed data in the network as well as to other relevant datasets, and provides tools for analysis. Specifically this project has two major technical goals:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1. Develop new methods and tools to help automate the updating of data flows from dynamically deployed sensors to publicly accessible biological databases.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2. Develop a suite of new algorithms and software for analysis of biological information to automate detection (real-time) of events based on data from sensors and databases, with applications to classification of signals to biological or physical events or to sensor failure, allowing rapid response.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The dissemination of analytical tools and framework developed will be useful to existing research projects, evolving environmental observing systems such as National Ecological Observatory Network, networks, agencies, international partners, and K-16 teachers. Graduate and under graduate students will participate in the project. Both software tools and basic research data from this project will be incorporated into existing and ongoing professional development resources for teachers and instructional resources for students in grades 6-12.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The PI will investigate methods for modeling and evaluating the decisions an agent must make when requesting quotes and when bidding for tasks that have complex time constraints and interdependencies. Time plays a major role in most human contracting and planning activities, yet current auction-based systems do not support decisions involving time constraints and inter-item dependencies. The way task schedules are specified in a Request for Quotes affects the number and types of bids received, and therefore the quality of the solutions that can be produced by such a system. Similarly, the way tasks are scheduled affects the ability of an agent to fit a new task into its own pre-existing commitments. The research will focus on two major goals: quantifying the relationships between schedules of tasks, bids, costs, and commitments of agents (to this end, the PI will develop theory, algorithms, and heuristics to maximize the expected utility for an agent scheduling tasks in a Request for Quotes and for an agent submitting bids); and experimentally validating the algorithms and heuristics in two application domains, supply-chain management and collaborative planning among robots and people. The project will provide a fundamental understanding of the tradeoffs between schedules and feasibility of tasks, in particular the dependencies between the way tasks are scheduled in a Request for Quotes, the bids they solicit, and their cost. The ability of agents to bid for tasks depends on their previous commitments, so different settings of time windows will end up soliciting different bids with different costs. The model proposed is based on Expected Utility Theory. Expected utility provides a natural way of accounting for the risk posture of the person or organization on whose behalf the agent is acting, and for modeling the tradeoffs between risks and profit expectations. The outcomes of the project will include a theoretical study of the dependencies between task schedules, bids, and costs, which will provide the foundations for efficient maximization algorithms and heuristics for determining optimal schedules, a collection of methods for generating practical schedules suitable for use in a Request for Quotes, algorithms and heuristics for an agent to generate bids for tasks with time and precedence constraints, and an experimental validation in two application domains, supply-chain management and collaborative planning among robots and people.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Broader Impact: This research will produce a new theoretical understanding of the interdependencies between time and costs, which will lay the foundations for designing more capable agents, and thus will increase the effectiveness of systems of agents. The application scenarios address real world problems, and have significant societal impact. Improving the efficiency of supply-chain management has the potential to decrease costs and open new markets. The results of this work will be especially useful in situations involving a large number of intersecting constraints and/or dynamic environments with evolving constraints. Enabling teams of robots and people to plan and interact will make robots more useful for tasks such as monitoring large areas or helping people in their daily life. The software tools developed will be made available to the community at large.</Abstract>

<Abstract>This project will develop user-oriented image management of distribution technologies for digital libraries. An interdisciplinary team of computer and information scientists from US, China, and Taiwan will investigate efficient ways to search digital collections of images using an integrated approach. The US team of researchers consists of faculty members and students of Simmons College, University of Pennsylvania, and The Pennsylvania State University. Several technology areas will be studied: (1) ontology-based image retrieval, (2) machine learning based image retrieval including object-based partial image search, (3) automatic image annotation, and (4) intellectual property (IP) protection techniques. The team will use real-world digital library datasets to develop user-oriented technologies suitable for practical deployment. Notably, the research will utilize an existing collection consisting of a large quantity of images associated with the first Emperor of China of all types of resolution and with enormous cultural significance as well as the existing rich descriptive information.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This project will advance understanding of digital imagery management and distribution technologies. It is likely to result in more efficient and effective methods for retrieving images from large collections. It will provide means to decrease labor-intensive activities by providing automatic image annotations. It will enable more willing networking of quality image collections in distributed locations with the access model and IP techniques to be developed by the project. The project has significance for addressing the issue of user-oriented image-related technologies in a general way. The resulting techniques can be applied to other subject contents as well as technology-driven domains, such as computer vision.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Among the positive broader impacts will be enhancement of the international infrastructure for digital library research, providing larger-scale universal access to culture and heritages than what is possible now, and expanding the participation of the global digital library research community. This project will also address the national need for scientists by training interdisciplinary graduate students and by offering new interdisciplinary courses for undergraduate students. This international partnership will promote the involvement of small college and minority students in this type of advanced multidisciplinary research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Today we have organizational and software procedures that facilitate the exchange of interpersonal information in social networking sites, instant messaging, bulletin boards, online role?playing games, computer?supported collaborative work, and online education. All of these applications fit into the larger category of social media that support virtual communities. As we increasingly rely on this cyberspace, the issue of privacy protection in social media is critically important. The objective of this project is to develop an advanced framework called U-Control for Digital Persona and Privacy Management to manage and release personal information considering a notion of digital persona based user privacy preferences and associated risks in disclosing such private information over virtual communities. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Successful completion of this project will result in the development of a protection framework and architecture to address the privacy challenges in social media-based virtual communities. This research effort is also expected to set an important direction to the future research in the area of virtual communities and online privacy solutions. This research has the potential for broad societal impact by providing user-controlled sharing of personal attributes and the efficiency of existing business models and operations of such.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Computer Science (31) This project involves systematically exploring the use of individualized questions and exercises in the context of programming-related courses. This approach is adapted from the Michigan State CAPA system that has been used in teaching physics. That system demonstrated its potential to help a larger percentage of the students to complete the course successfully as well as to help female students to bridge a traditional gap with their male classmates. A proof-of-concept system, QuizPACK, has already been developed. In the course of this project, the prototype system is being expanded in several aspects, and a series of studies will be run to find the most effective way of using this technology in programming-related courses.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In terms of intellectual merit, the project will extend the understanding of the role and place of individualized questions and exercises as an educational tool in programming courses as well as provide guidelines to researchers and practitioners. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Under broader impact, this project may provide an improvement in teaching programming-related courses (similar to the one achieved by CAPA in physics courses). These courses serve as the basis in computer science, information science, and information technology programs that have a critical value for the economy and security of our country. The PI hopes to influence the teaching of programming-related courses through dissemination of the research results and availability of the QuizPACK system to the community.</Abstract>
